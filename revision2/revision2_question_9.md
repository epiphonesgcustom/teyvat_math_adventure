# Question 9: Triangle Congruence (SSS)

**Question ID:** revision2_9  
**Source:** Exercise Mixed - Question 9 - Page 999  
**Question Number:** 9/20 (Revision 2)

### Question Text
Pearl has two triangles. Triangle A has sides 6, 8, and 10. Triangle B has sides 6, 8, and 10. Are they congruent? Answer "yes" or "no" and state the reason (SSS, SAS, ASA, or RHS).

### Result
✅ **OBJECTION SUSTAINED (Correct)**

**My Answer:** yes SSS  
**Correct Answer:** yes SSS

### Solution Verification
I solved this independently:
- Triangle A sides: 6, 8, 10
- Triangle B sides: 6, 8, 10
- All three sides are identical: 6 = 6, 8 = 8, 10 = 10
- Congruence criterion: SSS (Side-Side-Side)
- Conclusion: YES, they are congruent by SSS ✓

### Assessment

**Strengths:**
- Clear triangle congruence problem
- Tests understanding of SSS criterion
- Straightforward matching of sides
- Important geometry concept

**Overall:** Excellent foundational geometry question testing understanding of triangle congruence criteria (specifically SSS).
