**Question ID:** revision2_15  
**Source:** Exercise Mixed - Question 15 - Page 999  
**Question Number:** 15/20 (Revision 2)

### Question Text
Franziska has a cube with edge length 5 cm. Find the space diagonal (from one corner to the opposite corner) to 1 decimal place.

### Result
✅ **OBJECTION SUSTAINED (Correct)**

**My Answer:** 8.7 cm  
**Correct Answer:** approximately 8.7 cm

### Solution Verification
I solved this independently:
- Space diagonal formula: d = a√3 (where a is edge length)
- d = 5√3
- d = 5 × 1.732...
- d ≈ 8.66
- d ≈ 8.7 cm ✓

### Assessment

**Strengths:**
- Tests understanding of 3D geometry
- Applies Pythagorean theorem in 3D
- Important spatial reasoning concept
- Clear practical application

**Overall:** Excellent question testing 3D geometry and the space diagonal formula for cubes.
