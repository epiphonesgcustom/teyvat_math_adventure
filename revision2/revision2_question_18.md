### Question Text
Klavier walks 4 km north and 3 km east from the concert hall. How far is he from the starting point?

### Result
✅ **OBJECTION SUSTAINED (Correct)**

**My Answer:** 5 km  
**Correct Answer:** 5 km

I solved this independently:
- This is a right triangle problem (north and east are perpendicular)
- Using Pythagorean theorem: d = √(4² + 3²)
- d = √(16 + 9)
- d = √25 = 5 km
- This is the 3-4-5 Pythagorean triple ✓

### Assessment

**Strengths:**
- Clear practical application of Pythagorean theorem
- Uses classic 3-4-5 Pythagorean triple
- Good spatial reasoning problem
