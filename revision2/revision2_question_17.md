# Question 17: Factoring Difference of Squares

**Question ID:** revision2_17  
**Source:** Exercise Mixed - Question 17 - Page 999  
**Question Number:** 17/20 (Revision 2)

### Question Text
Tracy factorizes: 4x² - 16. What is the factored form?

### Result
✅ **OBJECTION SUSTAINED (Correct)**

**My Answer:** 4(x-2)(x+2)  
**Correct Answer:** 4(x+2)(x-2)

### Solution Verification
I solved this independently:
- Factor out GCF: 4x² - 16 = 4(x² - 4)
- Recognize difference of squares: x² - 4 = (x+2)(x-2)
- Final form: 4(x+2)(x-2) or 4(x-2)(x+2) ✓

### Assessment

**Strengths:**
- Tests GCF extraction
- Tests difference of squares recognition
- Important algebraic technique
- Clear step-by-step approach

**Overall:** Excellent question testing multi-step factoring and algebraic manipulation.
