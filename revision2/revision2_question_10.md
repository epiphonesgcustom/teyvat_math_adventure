**Question ID:** revision2_10  
**Source:** Exercise Mixed - Question 10 - Page 999  
**Question Number:** 10/20 (Revision 2)

### Question Text
Godot analyzes the sequence: 5, 9, 13, 17, ... What is the 15th term?

### Result
✅ **OBJECTION SUSTAINED (Correct)**

**My Answer:** 61  
**Correct Answer:** 61

### Solution Verification
I solved this independently:
- First term: a = 5
- Common difference: d = 9 - 5 = 4
- Arithmetic sequence formula: Tₙ = a + (n-1)d
- T₁₅ = 5 + (15-1) × 4
- T₁₅ = 5 + 14 × 4
- T₁₅ = 5 + 56 = 61 ✓

### Assessment

**Strengths:**
- Clear arithmetic sequence problem
- Tests understanding of sequence formulas
- Good application of nth term formula
- Straightforward calculation

**Overall:** Excellent foundational sequences and series question testing arithmetic sequence comprehension.
