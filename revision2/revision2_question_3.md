**Source:** Exercise Mixed - Question 3 - Page 999  
**Question Number:** 3/20 (Revision 2)

### Question Text
Edgeworth has two similar pyramids. The smaller has volume 64 cm³ and height 4 cm. The larger has height 6 cm. Find the volume of the larger pyramid.

### Result
✅ **OBJECTION SUSTAINED (Correct)**

**My Answer:** 216  
**Correct Answer:** 216 cm³

### Solution Verification
For similar solids, volume scales as the cube of the linear scale factor:
- Scale factor k = 6/4 = 1.5
- Volume scales by k³ = 1.5³ = 3.375
- V_large = 64 × 3.375 = 216 cm³ ✓
