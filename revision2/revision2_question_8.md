**Question ID:** revision2_8  
**Source:** Exercise Mixed - Question 8 - Page 999  
**Question Number:** 8/20 (Revision 2)

### Question Text
Klavier has a circular stage with diameter 20 meters. Find the circumference to 1 decimal place.

### Result
✅ **OBJECTION SUSTAINED (Correct)**

**My Answer:** 62.8 m  
**Correct Answer:** 62.8 m

### Solution Verification
I solved this independently:
- Circumference formula: C = πd
- Diameter = 20 m
- C = π × 20
- C = 20π ≈ 62.83...
- C ≈ 62.8 m ✓

### Assessment

**Strengths:**
- Straightforward circumference calculation
- Good real-world application (circular stage)
- Practical use of π
- Clear rounding to 1 decimal place

**Overall:** Excellent foundational geometry question testing understanding of circle circumference.
