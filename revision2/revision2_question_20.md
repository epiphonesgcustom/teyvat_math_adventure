**Question ID:** revision2_20  
**Source:** Exercise Mixed - Question 20 - Page 999  
**Question Number:** 20/20 (Revision 2) - THE FINAL QUESTION!

### Question Text
Godot has a rectangular container measuring 10 cm × 8 cm × 5 cm. What is its capacity in mL? (1 mL = 1 cm³)

### Result
✅ **OBJECTION SUSTAINED (Correct)**

**My Answer:** 400 mL  
**Correct Answer:** 400 mL

### Solution Verification
I solved this independently:
- Volume of rectangular prism: V = length × width × height
- V = 10 × 8 × 5
- V = 400 cm³
- Since 1 mL = 1 cm³: Capacity = 400 mL ✓

### Assessment

**Strengths:**
- Clear volume calculation problem
- Tests understanding of 3D rectangular prism
- Practical application (container capacity)
- Unit conversion (cm³ to mL)
- Excellent finale question

**Overall:** Perfect concluding question testing volume calculation and unit conversion in a practical context.
