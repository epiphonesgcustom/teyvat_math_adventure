# Question 11: Isosceles Right Triangle Angle

**Question ID:** revision2_11  
**Source:** Exercise Mixed - Question 11 - Page 999  
**Question Number:** 11/20 (Revision 2)

### Question Text
Phoenix has an isosceles right triangle with both legs equal to 7 cm. Find the acute angle θ in degrees (round to 1 decimal place).

### Result
✅ **OBJECTION SUSTAINED (Correct)**

**My Answer:** 45.0°  
**Correct Answer:** 45°

### Solution Verification
I solved this independently:
- Isosceles right triangle with both legs = 7 cm
- In an isosceles right triangle, the two acute angles are equal
- Sum of angles: 90° + θ + θ = 180°
- 2θ = 90°
- θ = 45°
- Using tan: tan θ = 7/7 = 1, so θ = arctan(1) = 45° ✓

### Assessment

**Strengths:**
- Clear application of isosceles right triangle properties
- Tests understanding of triangle angle sum
- Good trigonometric problem
- Important geometric concept

**Overall:** Excellent question testing both triangle properties and trigonometric understanding of isosceles right triangles.
