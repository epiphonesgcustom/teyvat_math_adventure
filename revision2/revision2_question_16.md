**Question ID:** revision2_16  
**Source:** Exercise Mixed - Question 16 - Page 999  
**Question Number:** 16/20 (Revision 2)

### Question Text
Detective Gumshoe has 5 red and 3 blue marbles. He draws two marbles with replacement. What is the probability both are red? Express as a fraction in simplest form.

### Result
✅ **OBJECTION SUSTAINED (Correct)**

**My Answer:** 25/64  
**Correct Answer:** 25/64

### Solution Verification
I solved this independently:
- Total marbles: 5 + 3 = 8
- P(red on 1st draw) = 5/8
- With replacement: P(red on 2nd draw) = 5/8
- P(both red) = (5/8) × (5/8) = 25/64 ✓

### Assessment

**Strengths:**
- Clear probability with replacement problem
- Tests understanding of independent events
- Requires fraction multiplication
- Good practical scenario

**Overall:** Excellent question testing probability with replacement and independent events.
