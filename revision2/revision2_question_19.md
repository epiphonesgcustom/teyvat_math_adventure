# Question 19: Similar Figures - Area Scaling

**Question ID:** revision2_19  
**Source:** Exercise Mixed - Question 19 - Page 999  
**Question Number:** 19/20 (Revision 2)

### Question Text
Pearl has a triangle with area 20 cm². A similar triangle has all sides twice as long. What is the area of the larger triangle?

### Result
✅ **OBJECTION SUSTAINED (Correct)**

**My Answer:** 80 cm²  
**Correct Answer:** 80 cm²

### Solution Verification
I solved this independently:
- Scale factor for linear dimensions: k = 2
- Area scales by the square of the linear scale factor: k² = 2² = 4
- New area = Original area × k²
- New area = 20 × 4 = 80 cm² ✓

### Assessment

**Strengths:**
- Tests understanding of similar figures
- Important concept: area scales with squared linear factor
- Excellent geometric reasoning problem
- Common misconception test (not 40, but 80)

**Overall:** Excellent question testing similar figures and area scaling relationships.
