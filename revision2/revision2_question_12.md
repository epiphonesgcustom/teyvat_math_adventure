**Question ID:** revision2_12  
**Source:** Exercise Mixed - Question 12 - Page 999  
**Question Number:** 12/20 (Revision 2)

### Question Text
Maya plays a game where she wins $5 with probability 0.4, wins $2 with probability 0.5, and loses $1 with probability 0.1. What is her expected value per game?

### Result
✅ **OBJECTION SUSTAINED (Correct)**

**My Answer:** 2.9  
**Correct Answer:** $2.90

### Solution Verification
I solved this independently:
- Expected value formula: E(X) = Σ(outcome × probability)
- E(X) = 5(0.4) + 2(0.5) + (-1)(0.1)
- E(X) = 2 + 1 + (-0.1)
- E(X) = 2.9 ✓

### Assessment

**Strengths:**
- Clear expected value problem
- Tests understanding of probability and expected value
- Practical game scenario
- Multiple outcomes with different probabilities
- Shows positive expected value (favorable game)

**Overall:** Excellent question testing expected value calculation with a practical real-world game scenario.
