## Question 10

**Source:** Exercise 8C - Question 1a - Page 151

**Question Text:** "Pearl found a triangular prism. The triangular face has base 4 cm and height 3 cm. The prism is 6 cm long. Find the surface area."

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** 84

**Explanation Provided:**
- Step 1: Triangle area = ½ × 4 × 3 = 6 cm²
- Step 2: Two triangular faces = 2 × 6 = 12 cm²
- Step 3: Three rectangular faces = (4×6) + (3×6) + (5×6) = 24 + 18 + 30 = 72 cm²
- (Note: third side = 5 cm using Pythagoras)
- Step 4: Total = 12 + 72 = 84 cm²

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Excellent progression! This introduces 3D surface area calculations for prisms, significantly stepping up complexity.
- Outstanding pedagogical value: requires understanding of composite surface areas (two triangular faces + three rectangular faces).
- The explanation clearly breaks down the calculation into logical steps, making the complex process transparent.
- Excellent pedagogical note: the explanation explicitly mentions using Pythagoras for the third side (5 cm from 3-4-5 triangle), reinforcing prior Chapter 5 knowledge.
- Good implicit requirement: students must recognize this is a 3-4-5 right triangle to find the hypotenuse without explicit instruction.
- Pearl Fey's character involvement provides narrative context while introducing 3D geometry problems.
- This naturally transitions from 2D area calculations to 3D surface area understanding.
- The problem elegantly combines multiple mathematical concepts: triangle area, rectangle area, and Pythagorean theorem.

**Minor Note:** The explanation helpfully states the third side is 5 cm using Pythagoras, but doesn't show the explicit calculation. For complete pedagogical clarity, it could show: √(3² + 4²) = √25 = 5 cm.
