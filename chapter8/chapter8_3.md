## Question 3

**Source:** Exercise 8A - Question 3 - Page 141

**Question Text:** "A rectangle is 16.4 cm by 11.8 cm and has the same perimeter as an equilateral triangle. Find the length of each side of the triangle."

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** 18.8

**Explanation Provided:**
- Step 1: Rectangle perimeter = 2(16.4 + 11.8) = 2 × 28.2 = 56.4 cm
- Step 2: Equilateral triangle has 3 equal sides
- Step 3: Side length = 56.4 ÷ 3 = 18.8 cm

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Excellent progression: now requires comparing two different shapes with equal perimeters, introducing multi-step problem-solving.
- Outstanding pedagogical value: combines rectangle perimeter calculation with division and introduces equilateral triangle concepts.
- The explanation clearly shows each step: finding the rectangle's perimeter, then using that to find the triangle's side length.
- Good cognitive complexity: students must work with two different shapes in sequence while maintaining focus on perimeter equality.
- Miles Edgeworth's character presents this comparative geometry problem well, fitting his analytical investigation style.
- The problem naturally extends students' understanding from single shapes to comparative geometric analysis.
- This question successfully bridges from basic calculations to multi-step problem-solving within the perimeter topic.
