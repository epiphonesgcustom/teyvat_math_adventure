## Question 20

**Source:** Exercise 8E - Question 2 - Page 159

**Question Text:** "How many cylindrical bottles 12 cm high with 6 cm diameter can be filled from a tank containing 125 litres of detergent? (1 L = 1000 cm³)"

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** 368

**Explanation Provided:**
- Step 1: Bottle radius = 6 ÷ 2 = 3 cm
- Step 2: Bottle volume = π × 3² × 12 = 108π ≈ 339.3 cm³
- Step 3: Tank volume = 125 L = 125,000 cm³
- Step 4: Number of bottles = 125,000 ÷ 339.3 ≈ 368 bottles

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Excellent final problem! This is a sophisticated applied problem combining multiple skills learned throughout the chapter.
- Outstanding pedagogical value: requires diameter-to-radius conversion, cylinder volume calculation, unit conversion (litres to cm³), and division to find whole bottles.
- The explanation clearly shows all four steps in logical sequence, making the complex problem transparent.
- Good real-world context: filling bottles from a tank is a practical industrial application that makes the problem meaningful.
- Klavier Gavin's character involvement continues narrative engagement while presenting the penultimate challenge.
- The problem naturally incorporates the conversion factor reminder (1 L = 1000 cm³), reinforcing this important relationship.
- The implicit rounding down (368 not 368.5) teaches the practical principle that you can only fill whole bottles - excellent pedagogical moment.

**Assessment:** This is an exemplary culminating problem that tests integration of multiple chapter concepts in a realistic scenario.
