## Question 1

**Source:** Exercise 8A - Question 1a - Page 141

**Question Text:** "Phoenix found a rectangular piece of evidence measuring 5.7 cm by 3.2 cm. What is the perimeter?"

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** 17.8

**Explanation Provided:**
- Step 1: Perimeter = 2 × (length + width)
- Step 2: P = 2 × (5.7 + 3.2)
- Step 3: P = 2 × 8.9
- Step 4: P = 17.8 cm

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Excellent opening question for Chapter 8: introduces the new topic (Area and Perimeter) with accessible, straightforward calculation.
- Outstanding pedagogical value: the formula is explicitly stated, and the step-by-step working is clear and easy to follow.
- Good use of decimals: introducing realistic measurements (5.7 cm, 3.2 cm) rather than whole numbers prepares students for real-world applications.
- Phoenix Wright's character discovery of rectangular evidence fits the narrative well and provides context.
- The question naturally introduces perimeter calculation as a foundational skill for the chapter.
- Clear, simple formula presentation ensures student understanding from the start.
- This question successfully establishes the chapter's focus on practical measurement applications.
