## Question 17

**Source:** Exercise 8E - Question 1a - Page 159

**Question Text:** "Detective Gumshoe found a box measuring 4 cm by 3 cm by 2 cm. Find the capacity in mL. (1 mL = 1 cm³)"

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** 24

**Explanation Provided:**
- Step 1: V = 4 × 3 × 2 = 24 cm³
- Step 2: Since 1 mL = 1 cm³
- Step 3: Capacity = 24 mL

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Excellent progression! This introduces the practical relationship between volume (cm³) and capacity (mL).
- Outstanding pedagogical value: explicitly connects the volume calculation to liquid capacity measurement, a key real-world application.
- The explanation helpfully includes the conversion reminder (1 mL = 1 cm³), making the relationship clear and memorable.
- Good practical context: finding "capacity" rather than just "volume" shifts the problem to real-world thinking (liquids, containers, measurement).
- Detective Gumshoe's character involvement continues narrative engagement while introducing capacity problems.
- The small box dimensions make the calculation straightforward, allowing focus on the volume-to-capacity concept rather than computational complexity.
- This naturally bridges from pure geometric volume to practical liquid measurement applications.
