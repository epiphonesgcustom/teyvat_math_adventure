## Question 5

**Source:** Exercise 8A - Question 4b - Page 141

**Question Text:** "Apollo measured a circular crime scene marker with radius 0.54 m. Calculate the circumference to 3 significant figures."

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** 3.39

**Explanation Provided:**
- Step 1: C = 2πr
- Step 2: C = 2 × π × 0.54
- Step 3: C ≈ 3.3929 m
- Step 4: Rounded to 3 s.f.: 3.39 m

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Excellent follow-up to Q4: now uses the alternative circumference formula C = 2πr (using radius instead of diameter).
- Outstanding pedagogical value: reinforces that both formulas (C = πd and C = 2πr) give the same result, showing mathematical equivalence.
- Good variation in measurement units: Q4 used cm, Q5 uses m, introducing different scale contexts.
- The explanation clearly shows both the formula application and significant figures rounding.
- Apollo Justice's measurement of a crime scene marker provides realistic narrative context.
- Good challenge factor: decimal radius (0.54 m) requires more careful calculation than the integer diameter in Q4.
- This naturally consolidates circumference understanding with both formula variants and introduces decimal measurements.
