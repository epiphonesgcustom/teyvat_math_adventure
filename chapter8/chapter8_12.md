## Question 12

**Source:** Exercise 8D - Question 2 - Page 157

**Question Text:** "A manufacturer has 2.4 m³ of rubber. Each eraser has volume 8 cm³. How many erasers can be made?"

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** 300000

**Explanation Provided:**
- Step 1: Convert 2.4 m³ to cm³
- Step 2: 1 m³ = 1,000,000 cm³
- Step 3: 2.4 m³ = 2,400,000 cm³
- Step 4: Number of erasers = 2,400,000 ÷ 8 = 300,000

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Excellent application problem! This applies volume unit conversions to a real-world manufacturing scenario.
- Outstanding pedagogical value: requires unit conversion (m³ to cm³) combined with division to solve a practical problem.
- The explanation clearly shows the conversion factor (1 m³ = 1,000,000 cm³), explicitly demonstrating the cubic scaling principle.
- Good real-world context: manufacturing erasers is relatable and makes the mathematical calculation meaningful.
- Larry Butz's character involvement provides narrative engagement while introducing practical applied mathematics.
- The large numbers (2,400,000) require careful calculation but are manageable with clear step-by-step guidance.
- This naturally demonstrates how geometric concepts (volume) apply to practical decision-making and resource management.

**Pedagogical Note:** Step 1 states "Convert 2.4 m³ to cm³" but doesn't show the calculation. Step 2-3 then show it, but it might be clearer to show the derivation more explicitly in Step 1 itself.
