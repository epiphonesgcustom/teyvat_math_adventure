## Question 6

**Source:** Exercise 8A - Question 6 - Page 141

**Question Text:** "Trucy found a circular stage with circumference 400 metres. Find the diameter to 1 decimal place."

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** 127.3

**Explanation Provided:**
- Step 1: C = πd, so d = C ÷ π
- Step 2: d = 400 ÷ π
- Step 3: d ≈ 127.324 m
- Step 4: Rounded to 1 d.p.: 127.3 m

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Excellent progression: now solving for diameter given circumference (inverse operation from Q4-5).
- Outstanding pedagogical value: requires rearranging the circumference formula to solve for diameter, reinforcing algebraic manipulation.
- The explanation clearly shows the formula rearrangement (C = πd becomes d = C ÷ π), explicitly teaching the solving process.
- Good application context: a circular stage provides realistic measurement scenario at a large scale (400 m circumference).
- Trucy Wright's character involvement maintains narrative engagement while introducing large-scale circular measurements.
- The 1 decimal place rounding is slightly less precise than previous 3 significant figures, introducing variety in rounding requirements.
- This naturally consolidates circumference understanding by shifting from forward calculation to inverse problem-solving.
