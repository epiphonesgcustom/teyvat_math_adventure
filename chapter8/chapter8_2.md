## Question 2

**Source:** Exercise 8A - Question 2 - Page 141

**Question Text:** "Maya discovered an isosceles triangle with base 7.8 cm and perimeter 30 cm. What is the length of each equal side?"

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** 11.1

**Explanation Provided:**
- Step 1: Let the equal sides be x cm
- Step 2: Perimeter = 7.8 + 2x = 30
- Step 3: 2x = 30 - 7.8 = 22.2
- Step 4: x = 11.1 cm

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Excellent progression from Q1: introduces reverse perimeter calculation (finding unknown side given total perimeter).
- Outstanding pedagogical value: requires algebraic thinking within the perimeter context, connecting to equation-solving skills.
- The explanation clearly shows variable definition and algebraic steps, reinforcing problem-solving methodology.
- Good use of realistic measurements with decimals maintains practical application focus.
- Maya Fey's character discovery provides narrative context while introducing isosceles triangle concepts.
- The step-by-step algebraic breakdown is clear and educational, showing how to isolate the variable.
- This naturally progresses the chapter's learning by shifting from direct calculation to inverse problem-solving.
