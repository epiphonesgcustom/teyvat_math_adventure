## Question 13

**Source:** Exercise 8D - Question 3a - Page 157

**Question Text:** "Wendy found a box measuring 1.6 m by 1.1 m by 1.4 m. Find the volume in m³."

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** 2.464

**Explanation Provided:**
- Step 1: V = l × w × h
- Step 2: V = 1.6 × 1.1 × 1.4
- Step 3: V = 2.464 m³

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Excellent progression! This introduces rectangular prism (cuboid) volume calculation with decimal dimensions.
- Outstanding pedagogical value: straightforward application of the volume formula V = length × width × height.
- The explanation clearly presents the formula and its application, making the calculation transparent.
- Good use of decimal dimensions (1.6, 1.1, 1.4): prevents pattern-matching and requires careful calculation.
- Wendy Oldbag's character discovery of a box provides narrative context while introducing 3D volume problems.
- The three-step explanation is clear and easy to follow, with proper formula notation (l × w × h).
- This naturally consolidates volume understanding with practical applications to everyday objects (boxes).

**Minor Note:** The explanation shows the calculation but doesn't break down the intermediate steps (1.6 × 1.1 = 1.76, then 1.76 × 1.4 = 2.464). For students who struggle with multi-step decimal multiplication, showing intermediate results could be helpful.
