## Question 9

**Source:** Exercise 8B - Question 1d - Page 144

**Question Text:** "Convert 500,000 cm² into m²."

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** 50

**Explanation Provided:**
- Step 1: 1 m² = 10,000 cm²
- Step 2: To convert cm² to m², divide by 10,000
- Step 3: 500,000 ÷ 10,000 = 50 m²

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Excellent follow-up to Q8: now performs the inverse conversion (cm² to m² instead of m² to cm²).
- Outstanding pedagogical value: explicitly teaches the division method for inverse unit conversions, complementing Q8's multiplication approach.
- The explanation clearly states the conversion principle: "divide by 10,000" for the reverse direction.
- Good pedagogical pairing: Q8 multiplies to convert down in scale, Q9 divides to convert up in scale, showing both directions.
- Godot's character involvement continues narrative consistency while presenting unit conversion problems.
- The large numbers (500,000) require careful calculation but are manageable, testing computational confidence without being overwhelming.
- This naturally reinforces unit conversion understanding with bidirectional examples.
