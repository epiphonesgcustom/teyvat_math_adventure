## Question 4

**Source:** Exercise 8A - Question 4a - Page 141

**Question Text:** "Detective Gumshoe found a circular button with diameter 11 cm. Calculate the circumference to 3 significant figures."

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** 34.6

**Explanation Provided:**
- Step 1: C = π × d
- Step 2: C = π × 11
- Step 3: C ≈ 34.558 cm
- Step 4: Rounded to 3 s.f.: 34.6 cm

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Excellent transition! This introduces circles and circumference, expanding from polygons to curved shapes.
- Outstanding pedagogical value: introduces the circumference formula C = πd with practical application to a circular object.
- The explanation clearly shows the formula application and includes proper significant figures rounding (3 s.f.).
- Good introduction of π: the formula is straightforward, allowing focus on the concept rather than complex calculation.
- Detective Gumshoe's discovery of a circular button provides realistic narrative context while introducing the new shape.
- The rounding instruction (3 significant figures) reinforces precision and accuracy in measurement contexts.
- This naturally extends the chapter from perimeter (polygon boundaries) to circumference (circular boundaries).
