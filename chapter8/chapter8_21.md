## Question 21 (FINAL)

**Source:** Exercise 8E - Question 5 - Page 159

**Question Text:** "A 1 litre cylindrical paint can has base radius 5 cm. Find the height of the can to 1 decimal place."

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** 12.7

**Explanation Provided:**
- Step 1: Capacity = 1 L = 1000 cm³
- Step 2: V = πr²h, so h = V ÷ (πr²)
- Step 3: h = 1000 ÷ (π × 5²)
- Step 4: h = 1000 ÷ 25π ≈ 12.73 cm ≈ 12.7 cm

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Outstanding capstone question! This inverts the cylinder volume problem, requiring algebraic rearrangement.
- Outstanding pedagogical value: asks students to solve for height given volume and radius, testing deeper understanding of the formula.
- The explanation clearly shows the formula rearrangement (V = πr²h becomes h = V ÷ πr²), explicitly teaching algebraic manipulation.
- Good connection to real-world context: paint cans are practical objects students can relate to, making the problem meaningful.
- Franziska von Karma's character perfectly suits this final challenge - demanding precision and correctness in the last problem.
- The conversion reminder (1 L = 1000 cm³) reinforces this crucial relationship one final time.
- The problem elegantly closes the chapter by returning to cylinder geometry but approaching it from a different angle (finding height instead of volume).

**Assessment:** This is an exemplary final question that tests not just calculation but conceptual understanding of how formulas work. It demonstrates that students truly understand the relationship between volume, radius, and height by requiring them to solve for one when given the others.
