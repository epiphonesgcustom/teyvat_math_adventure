## Question 19

**Source:** Exercise 8E - Question 1c - Page 159

**Question Text:** "Trucy found a spherical container with radius 36 mm. Find the capacity in mL to 1 decimal place. (Hint: Convert mm to cm first)"

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** 195.4

**Explanation Provided:**
- Step 1: Convert radius: 36 mm = 3.6 cm
- Step 2: V = (4/3)πr³
- Step 3: V = (4/3) × π × 3.6³
- Step 4: V ≈ 195.43 cm³ = 195.4 mL

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Excellent progression! This introduces sphere volume, the final major 3D shape in the chapter.
- Outstanding pedagogical value: introduces the sphere volume formula V = (4/3)πr³ with clear step-by-step application.
- The hint "Convert mm to cm first" is helpful and prevents students from getting lost in the conversion process.
- Good pedagogical design: the mm-to-cm conversion (36 mm = 3.6 cm) requires understanding of metric conversions while testing the sphere formula.
- Trucy Wright's character involvement continues narrative engagement while introducing sphere volume.
- The cubic calculation (3.6³ = 46.656) is non-trivial but manageable with proper guidance.
- The explanation correctly connects volume to capacity (cm³ = mL).
- This elegantly completes the 3D shapes progression: prism → pyramid → cylinder → cone → sphere.

**Pedagogical Note:** The explanation could be slightly clearer by showing the intermediate calculation: 3.6³ = 46.656, then (4/3) × 46.656π = 62.208π ≈ 195.43. The current explanation is clear enough but this extra detail might help struggling students verify their own calculations.
