## Question 15

**Source:** Exercise 8D - Question 5a - Page 157

**Question Text:** "Maya discovered a square pyramid with base side 6 m and height 4 m. Find the volume."

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** 48

**Explanation Provided:**
- Step 1: V = (1/3) × base area × height
- Step 2: Base area = 6² = 36 m²
- Step 3: V = (1/3) × 36 × 4
- Step 4: V = 48 m³

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Excellent progression! This introduces pyramid volume, extending to cone-like shapes with pointed apexes.
- Outstanding pedagogical value: introduces the pyramid volume formula V = (1/3) × base area × height, clearly showing the relationship to prism volumes.
- The explanation logically breaks down the problem: first finding base area, then applying the formula.
- Good pedagogical insight: the 1/3 factor is explicitly stated, helping students understand that a pyramid is 1/3 the volume of a prism with the same base and height.
- Maya Fey's character discovery of a pyramid provides narrative context while introducing this new shape.
- The whole number result (48 m³) makes the answer clean and satisfying, allowing focus on the concept rather than calculation complexity.
- This naturally demonstrates how different 3D shapes have related but distinct volume formulas.
