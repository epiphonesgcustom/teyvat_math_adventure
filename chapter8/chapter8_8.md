## Question 8

**Source:** Exercise 8B - Question 1c - Page 144

**Question Text:** "Convert 3.5 m² into cm². (Remember: 1 m = 100 cm)"

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** 35000

**Explanation Provided:**
- Step 1: 1 m = 100 cm
- Step 2: 1 m² = 100 × 100 = 10,000 cm²
- Step 3: 3.5 m² = 3.5 × 10,000 cm²
- Step 4: = 35,000 cm²

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Excellent transition! This marks the shift from perimeter/circumference to area, and introduces the concept of unit conversion for areas.
- Outstanding pedagogical value: explicitly shows that area conversion requires squaring the linear conversion factor (100² not 100).
- The explanation beautifully demonstrates the principle: Step 2 clearly shows why 1 m² = 10,000 cm² by showing the squaring process.
- The reminder in parentheses (1 m = 100 cm) is helpful for students who might not immediately recognize the conversion factor.
- Franziska von Karma's character involvement continues narrative engagement as the chapter transitions to new topics.
- This naturally bridges from understanding perimeters to understanding areas, with explicit unit conversion guidance.
- The step-by-step breakdown of the squaring rule for area conversions is excellent preparation for further unit conversions.
