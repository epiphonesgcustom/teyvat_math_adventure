## Question 14

**Source:** Exercise 8D - Question 3d - Page 157

**Question Text:** "Phoenix examined a cylindrical evidence container. The radius is 3 cm and height is 8 cm. Find the volume to 1 decimal place."

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** 226.2

**Explanation Provided:**
- Step 1: V = πr²h
- Step 2: V = π × 3² × 8
- Step 3: V = π × 9 × 8 = 72π
- Step 4: V ≈ 226.19 cm³ ≈ 226.2 cm³

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Excellent progression! This introduces cylinder volume, extending 3D geometry to curved surfaces.
- Outstanding pedagogical value: introduces the cylinder volume formula V = πr²h with clear step-by-step derivation.
- The explanation shows the formula application and the simplification process (π × 9 × 8 = 72π), making the calculation transparent.
- Good rounding practice: shows the full value (226.19...) before rounding to 1 decimal place.
- Phoenix Wright's character examination of a cylindrical evidence container provides realistic narrative context.
- The formula is presented cleanly with proper mathematical notation (V = πr²h).
- This naturally extends from rectangular to cylindrical volume calculations, showing volume principles across different shapes.
