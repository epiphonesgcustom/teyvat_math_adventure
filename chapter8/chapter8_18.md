## Question 18

**Source:** Exercise 8E - Question 1b - Page 159

**Question Text:** "A cylindrical container has diameter 3.4 cm and height 2.6 cm. Find the capacity in mL to 1 decimal place."

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** 23.6

**Explanation Provided:**
- Step 1: Radius = 3.4 ÷ 2 = 1.7 cm
- Step 2: V = πr²h = π × 1.7² × 2.6
- Step 3: V ≈ 23.63 cm³
- Step 4: Capacity = 23.6 mL (since 1 cm³ = 1 mL)

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Excellent progression! This combines cylinder volume with capacity measurement, requiring diameter-to-radius conversion first.
- Outstanding pedagogical value: adds the intermediate step of finding radius from diameter, testing student understanding of radius-diameter relationships.
- The explanation clearly shows all steps: diameter to radius conversion, volume formula application, and capacity conversion.
- Good practical application: cylindrical containers are common in real life, making the problem highly relevant.
- Apollo Justice's character involvement continues narrative engagement while presenting capacity problems.
- The decimal dimensions (3.4, 2.6) prevent simple calculation and test real problem-solving ability.
- This elegantly combines multiple concepts: diameter/radius, cylinder volume, and capacity measurement in a practical context.
