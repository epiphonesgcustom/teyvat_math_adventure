## Question 7

**Source:** Exercise 8A - Question 7a - Page 141

**Question Text:** "Klavier found a circular arc with radius 12.5 cm and central angle 60°. Calculate the arc length to 1 decimal place."

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** 13.1

**Explanation Provided:**
- Step 1: Arc length = (θ/360) × 2πr
- Step 2: Arc = (60/360) × 2π × 12.5
- Step 3: Arc = (1/6) × 25π
- Step 4: Arc ≈ 13.09 cm ≈ 13.1 cm

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Excellent progression! This introduces arc length, a natural extension from full circumference to partial circle concepts.
- Outstanding pedagogical value: introduces the central angle as a key parameter and shows the fractional relationship (60/360 = 1/6).
- The explanation clearly shows the formula and the simplification process, making the calculation transparent and logical.
- Good simplification step (Step 3): showing (1/6) × 25π demonstrates mathematical insight beyond mere formula application.
- Klavier Gavin's character discovery of an arc provides thematic variety while introducing the new concept.
- The 60° angle is pedagogically wise: it's a "nice" angle (1/6 of a circle) that simplifies the calculation and intuition.
- This naturally extends perimeter/circumference understanding to partial circular measurements.
