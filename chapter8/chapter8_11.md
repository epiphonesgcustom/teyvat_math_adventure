## Question 11

**Source:** Exercise 8D - Question 1a - Page 157

**Question Text:** "Convert 8.65 cm³ into mm³. (Remember: 1 cm = 10 mm)"

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** 8650

**Explanation Provided:**
- Step 1: 1 cm = 10 mm
- Step 2: 1 cm³ = 10 × 10 × 10 = 1000 mm³
- Step 3: 8.65 cm³ = 8.65 × 1000 mm³
- Step 4: = 8650 mm³

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Excellent progression! This introduces volume unit conversions, naturally extending from area conversions.
- Outstanding pedagogical value: explicitly shows that volume conversion requires cubing the linear conversion factor (10³ = 1000, not 10 or 100).
- The explanation clearly demonstrates why 1 cm³ = 1000 mm³ by showing the cubic expansion: 10 × 10 × 10.
- Good reinforcement of the pattern: Q8 squared the linear factor for area, Q11 cubes it for volume, showing the systematic relationship.
- Judge's character involvement provides authoritative narrative context while introducing volume concepts.
- The decimal input (8.65) prevents pattern-matching and requires understanding of the conversion principle.
- This naturally extends the unit conversion sequence from length → area → volume.
