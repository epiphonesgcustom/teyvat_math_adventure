## Question 20

**Source:** Exercise 5A - Question 4b - Page 93

**Question Text:** "Apollo found evidence with sides √7 cm and √5 cm. Find the hypotenuse x in surd form."

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** 2√3

**Explanation Provided:**
- Step 1: x² = (√7)² + (√5)²
- Step 2: x² = 7 + 5 = 12
- Step 3: x = √12
- Step 4: Simplify: √12 = √(4×3) = 2√3 cm

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Excellent continuation of surd-based problems with both inputs and output involving surds.
- Outstanding pedagogical design: requires both surd arithmetic (√a)² = a and surd simplification (√12 = 2√3).
- The step-by-step simplification clearly shows the factorization process, reinforcing algebraic manipulation skills.
- Good progression from Q19: both sides given as surds (rather than hypotenuse), testing different formula applications.
- Apollo Justice's character continues the narrative consistency within the surd section.
- Clean factorization: 12 = 4×3 makes the simplification straightforward and educational.
- Excellent reinforcement of core surd skills: squaring surds, adding under the root, and simplifying composite expressions.
