## Question 1

**Source:** Exercise 5A - Question 1a - Page 93

**Question Text:** "The witness claims he measured a triangular crime scene marker. The two perpendicular sides are 7 cm and 4 cm. What is the length of the hypotenuse? Give your answer in simplest surd form."

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** √65

**Explanation Provided:**
- Step 1: Apply Pythagorean Theorem: c² = a² + b²
- Step 2: c² = 7² + 4²
- Step 3: c² = 49 + 16 = 65
- Step 4: c = √65 cm
- This is already in simplest surd form.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- The question and answer mechanism work well. The step-by-step explanation is clear and educational.
- Consider adding a visual diagram of the triangle (which is good here) to help players visualize the problem.
- The reference to "witness claims" adds nice narrative context to a math problem.
