## Question 9

**Source:** Exercise 5A - Question 2c - Page 93

**Question Text:** "Apollo examined a triangular piece of evidence. One side is 3 cm and the hypotenuse is 9 cm. Find the unknown side in surd form."

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** 6√2

**Explanation Provided:**
- Step 1: a² = 9² - 3²
- Step 2: a² = 81 - 9 = 72
- Step 3: a = √72
- Step 4: Simplify: √72 = √(36×2) = 6√2 cm

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Excellent progressive question requiring surd simplification with a coefficient result.
- The factorization of 72 into 36×2 is clean and teachable.
- Apollo Justice's character maintains the narrative consistency.
- Good variety: Q8 had a perfect square result, Q9 requires simplification—nice pedagogical rhythm.
- This question effectively reinforces surd simplification skills after testing different variations.
