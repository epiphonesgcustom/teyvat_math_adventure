## Question 17

**Source:** Exercise 5A - Question 3e - Page 93

**Question Text:** "Detective Gumshoe needs help with measurements. The hypotenuse is 4.9 m and the height is 1.7 m. Find the base to 1 decimal place."

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** 4.6

**Explanation Provided:**
- Step 1: a² = 4.9² - 1.7²
- Step 2: a² = 24.01 - 2.89 = 21.12
- Step 3: a = √21.12 ≈ 4.60 m
- Step 4: To 1 decimal place: 4.6 m

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Excellent continued progression with decimal values and rounding to 1 d.p.
- Good use of a triangle with unequal leg lengths that tests careful calculation with decimals.
- Detective Gumshoe's return as a character provides continuity and thematic consistency with evidence measurement.
- The intermediate calculation shown (24.01 - 2.89 = 21.12) is helpful for transparency.
- Clean rounding situation: 4.60 rounds straightforwardly to 4.6 m.
- Good variety in triangle dimensions - neither side dominates, creating a more balanced triangle shape than Q15.
- The question naturally uses "height" and "base" terminology rather than generic "sides," which reinforces proper geometric language.
