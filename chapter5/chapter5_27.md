## Question 27

**Source:** Exercise 5B - Question 3d - Page 97

**Question Text:** "Gumshoe needs help with {8, k, k+2}. The hypotenuse is k+2. Find k."

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** 15

**Explanation Provided:**

* Step 1: 8² + k² = (k+2)²
* Step 2: 64 + k² = k² + 4k + 4
* Step 3: 64 = 4k + 4
* Step 4: 60 = 4k
* Step 5: k = 15
* Verification: {8, 15, 17} is indeed a Pythagorean triple!

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

* Outstanding progression! This moves beyond simple triple identification to algebraic problem-solving with variables.
* Excellent pedagogical value: requires expanding (k+2)², combining like terms, and solving linear equations from a Pythagorean relationship.
* The step-by-step expansion clearly shows the cancellation of k² terms, which is crucial for student understanding of the algebraic process.
* The verification at the end (identifying 8-15-17 as a Pythagorean triple) is excellent educational reinforcement.
* This represents a peak complexity for this section, bridging Pythagorean theorem with genuine algebra problem-solving.
* Good cognitive load: students must work through multiple algebraic steps while maintaining focus on the original Pythagorean context.
* Detective Gumshoe's character request for help maintains narrative engagement while presenting challenging content.
* Excellent progression within Section 5B from simple triple finding to algebraic problem-solving.
