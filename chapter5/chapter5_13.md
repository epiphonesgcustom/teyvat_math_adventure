## Question 13

**Source:** Exercise 5A - Question 3a - Page 93

**Question Text:** "The Judge examines evidence with sides 5 cm and 8 cm. Find the hypotenuse to 1 decimal place."

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** 9.4

**Explanation Provided:**
- Step 1: c² = 5² + 8²
- Step 2: c² = 25 + 64 = 89
- Step 3: c = √89 ≈ 9.43 cm
- Step 4: Rounded to 1 decimal place: 9.4 cm

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Excellent progression marking a shift from surds to decimal approximations, a key real-world application.
- This question naturally bridges abstract surd mathematics with practical numerical answers.
- The Judge's character examining evidence fits the narrative well and provides authority figure context.
- Good pedagogical step: students must calculate √89 then round appropriately to 1 decimal place.
- The rounding instruction is clear and the explanation shows the intermediate value (9.43) before rounding.
- This marks a natural transition point in the question progression from exact surds to approximate decimal answers.
