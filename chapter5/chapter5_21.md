## Question 21

**Source:** Exercise 5A - Question 4c - Page 93

**Question Text:** "Trucy shows you an isosceles right triangle! Two equal sides are x cm each, and the hypotenuse is √10 cm. Find x."

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** √5

**Explanation Provided:**
- Step 1: x² + x² = (√10)²
- Step 2: 2x² = 10
- Step 3: x² = 5
- Step 4: x = √5 cm

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Excellent problem type: isosceles right triangles with surds introduces algebraic manipulation (2x² = 10 → x² = 5).
- Outstanding pedagogical value: requires combining like terms (x² + x²), dividing by 2, and working with surds simultaneously.
- The step-by-step explanation clearly shows the algebraic steps, making the logic transparent for learning.
- Great narrative touch: Trucy describing it as a special "isosceles right triangle" educates players about this important triangle type while maintaining character interaction.
- The relationship between √5 and √10 is clean: √10 = √(2×5) = √2 × √5, which reinforces deeper surd relationships.
- Good pedagogical progression: this requires more algebraic manipulation than previous surd questions, representing a genuine step up in complexity.
- 5 is prime, so √5 is in simplest form - a satisfying resolution to the calculation.
