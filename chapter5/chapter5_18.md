## Question 18

**Source:** Exercise 5A - Question 3f - Page 93

**Question Text:** "Franziska presents evidence: a triangle with base 22 cm and hypotenuse 14.1 cm. Find the height to 1 decimal place."

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** impossible

**Explanation Provided:**
- The hypotenuse (14.1 cm) cannot be shorter than the base (22 cm).
- In any right triangle, the hypotenuse is the longest side.
- Franziska's evidence is contradictory!

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Excellent second logical impossibility check within the decimal rounding section - provides good reinforcement of fundamental triangle properties.
- Perfect character narrative: Franziska as a prosecutor presenting "evidence" that can be logically disproven reinforces the meta-narrative of the Ace Attorney series.
- The significantly larger discrepancy (22 cm vs 14.1 cm) compared to Q16 makes this an even more obvious logical error, providing good gradation in difficulty.
- Good pedagogical placement: alternating between normal calculations (Q17) and conceptual checks (Q18) maintains student engagement and prevents monotony.
- The question maintains the decimal number format (14.1 cm) even though the error is immediately obvious, testing whether students verify logical validity before attempting calculation.
- Excellent narrative payoff: "Franziska's evidence is contradictory!" ties perfectly to the Ace Attorney theme of cross-examination and evidence contradiction.
