## Question 35

**Source:** Exercise 5D - Question 1f - Page 102

**Question Text:** "Phoenix verifies evidence: 8 m, 15 m, and 17 m. Is this a right triangle? Answer "yes" or "no"."

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** yes

**Explanation Provided:**
- Step 1: Longest: 17 m
- Step 2: Check: 17² = 8² + 15²?
- Step 3: 289 = 64 + 225
- Step 4: 289 = 289 ✓
- A perfect right triangle!

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Excellent callback! This is the famous 8-15-17 Pythagorean triple from Q28, demonstrating the pedagogical coherence of the curriculum.
- Outstanding educational moment: recognizing the same triple in different contexts (algebraic generation vs. direct verification) reinforces deep pattern recognition.
- The explanation explicitly identifies this as "the classic 8-15-17 triple," connecting to earlier material excellently.
- Perfect closure to the verification section: using a well-known triple provides satisfying confirmation of mastery.
- Phoenix's character verification maintains narrative continuity while presenting a verification problem that directly references earlier algebraic work.
- The perfect equality (289 = 289) provides mathematical beauty and satisfying closure.
- This naturally serves as a bridge between verification work and the final questions, establishing confidence before the chapter conclusion.
