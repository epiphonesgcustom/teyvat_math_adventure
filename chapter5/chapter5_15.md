## Question 15

**Source:** Exercise 5A - Question 3c - Page 93

**Question Text:** "Maya needs your help! The hypotenuse is 9 cm and one side is 2 cm. Find the other side to 1 decimal place."

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** 8.8

**Explanation Provided:**
- Step 1: a² = 9² - 2²
- Step 2: a² = 81 - 4 = 77
- Step 3: a = √77 ≈ 8.77 cm
- Step 4: Rounded to 1 decimal place: 8.8 cm

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Excellent question with a notably disparate side ratio (9 cm hypotenuse vs 2 cm side) that creates a challenging but realistic scenario.
- Good pedagogical choice: tests rounding with a value very close to the boundary (8.77 rounds to 8.8, not 8.7).
- The Maya Fey narrative ("Maya needs your help!") adds emotional engagement to the problem.
- Clear intermediate value shown (8.77) helps players understand the rounding decision.
- Good variety: this is a much more extreme triangle shape compared to Q13 and Q14, reinforcing that the Pythagorean theorem works across all triangle proportions.
- Minor note: The answer 8.8 could potentially be confused with the question Q14's answer (7.1) in a quick glance, but the distinct numbers and contexts help mitigate this.
