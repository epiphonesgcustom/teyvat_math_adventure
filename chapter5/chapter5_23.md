## Question 23

**Source:** Exercise 5A - Question 4f - Page 93

**Question Text:** "The Judge examines a triangle with sides (√3)/2 m and 1 m. Find hypotenuse x in surd form."

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** √7/2

**Explanation Provided:**

* Step 1: x² = ((√3)/2)² + 1²
* Step 2: x² = 3/4 + 1
* Step 3: x² = 3/4 + 4/4 = 7/4
* Step 4: x = √(7/4) = (√7)/2 m

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

* Excellent challenge question introducing fractional surds: requires understanding how to handle surds with rational coefficients and denominators.
* Outstanding algebraic complexity: combining fractions under a square root, then simplifying √(7/4) to (√7)/2 requires mastery of multiple concepts.
* The step-by-step explanation clearly shows fraction addition (3/4 + 4/4) and square root simplification, reinforcing essential skills.
* Good pedagogical progression: this represents one of the most complex variations possible with Pythagorean theorem and surds.
* The fractional input ((√3)/2) combined with integer (1) tests flexible thinking about different numerical forms.
* The simplified form (√7)/2 is cleaner than √(7/4), teaching students the value of simplifying square roots of fractions.
* This question naturally represents the peak complexity of surd-based Pythagorean theorem questions, testing comprehensive mastery.
