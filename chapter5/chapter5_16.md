## Question 16

**Source:** Exercise 5A - Question 3d - Page 93

**Question Text:** "Edgeworth measures a triangular piece of evidence. The base is 8.5 cm and the hypotenuse is 6.1 cm. Wait... is this possible? Find the height to 1 decimal place, or state if impossible."

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** impossible

**Explanation Provided:**
- The hypotenuse (6.1 cm) is shorter than the base (8.5 cm).
- The hypotenuse must always be the longest side in a right triangle.
- The witness has made a critical error!

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Excellent use of a logical fallacy detection question - reinforces fundamental triangle properties within the decimal rounding section.
- Perfect narrative fit: Edgeworth as a meticulous prosecutor catching measurement inconsistencies emphasizes the importance of logical reasoning over blind calculation.
- The question text hint "Wait... is this possible?" is helpful for players to consider the validity of the triangle before attempting calculation.
- Good pedagogical design: breaks up the monotony of pure calculation exercises with conceptual verification.
- This is an important check on student understanding - showing that not all sets of measurements can form a valid triangle.
- Excellent continuation of the pattern established in Q10, now applied within the decimal approximation section of the curriculum.
