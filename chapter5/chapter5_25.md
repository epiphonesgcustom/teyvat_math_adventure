## Question 25

**Source:** Exercise 5B - Question 3b - Page 97

**Question Text:** "Maya found a mystic triple {11, 60, k}. Find the missing value k."

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** 61

**Explanation Provided:**

* Step 1: k is the hypotenuse
* Step 2: k² = 11² + 60²
* Step 3: k² = 121 + 3600 = 3721
* Step 4: k = √3721 = 61

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

* Excellent introduction of a less commonly known Pythagorean triple (11-60-61) compared to the ubiquitous 3-4-5 and 5-12-13.
* Good pedagogical value: broadens students' exposure to Pythagorean triples beyond the "famous" ones.
* The "mystic triple" narrative label is fitting for Maya Fey's character and adds thematic flavor.
* The calculation is straightforward but requires confidence: 121 + 3600 = 3721, and recognizing √3721 = 61.
* Note: The explanation does not name this as the 11-60-61 triple (unlike Q25's identification of 3-4-5 scaled). Consider adding this educational note.
* Good variety in triple selection keeps the curriculum interesting and prevents pattern-matching without understanding.
* This question maintains difficulty while introducing less familiar Pythagorean relationships.
