## Question 4

**Source:** Exercise 5A - Question 1d - Page 93

**Question Text:** "Maya found a triangular spirit charm. The two perpendicular sides both measure 5 cm. What is the hypotenuse length in surd form?"

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** 5√2

**Explanation Provided:**
- Step 1: c² = 5² + 5²
- Step 2: c² = 25 + 25 = 50
- Step 3: c = √50
- Step 4: Simplify: √50 = √(25×2) = 5√2 cm

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Great question testing surd simplification with equal sides (isosceles right triangle).
- Clear step-by-step simplification showing the factorization process is excellent for learning.
- Maya Fey's narrative flavor about a "spirit charm" maintains thematic consistency.
- The progression of questions now covers: non-simplifiable primes, perfect squares, and simplified surds with coefficients.
