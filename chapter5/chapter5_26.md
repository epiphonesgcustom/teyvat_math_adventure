## Question 26

**Source:** Exercise 5B - Question 3c - Page 97

**Question Text:** "Edgeworth presents the triple {24, k, 51}. The largest value 51 is the hypotenuse. Find k."

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** 45

**Explanation Provided:**

* Step 1: 51 is the hypotenuse
* Step 2: k² = 51² - 24²
* Step 3: k² = 2601 - 576 = 2025
* Step 4: k = √2025 = 45

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

* Excellent progression! This now presents a triple where the missing value is a leg, requiring subtraction from the hypotenuse formula.
* Outstanding pedagogical value: tests flexible thinking about which side to solve for and appropriate rearrangement of the theorem.
* The problem statement helpfully clarifies that "51 is the hypotenuse," removing ambiguity and focusing the learning on rearrangement logic.
* The calculation is more complex: 51² = 2601 is less intuitive than previous values, challenging computational confidence.
* Note: Like Q26, the explanation does not name this as the 7-24-25 triple scaled by 3. Consider adding this for educational enrichment.
* Good difficulty progression within the Pythagorean triple section, building from hypotenuse finding to leg finding.
* The solution √2025 = 45 is clean and satisfying after the more complex subtraction.
