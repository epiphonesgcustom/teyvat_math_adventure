## Question 14

**Source:** Exercise 5A - Question 3b - Page 93

**Question Text:** "Phoenix investigates a triangular crime scene. The hypotenuse is 10 m and one side is 7 m. Find the unknown side to 1 decimal place."

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** 7.1

**Explanation Provided:**
- Step 1: a² = 10² - 7²
- Step 2: a² = 100 - 49 = 51
- Step 3: a = √51 ≈ 7.14 m
- Step 4: Rounded to 1 decimal place: 7.1 m

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Excellent continuation of the decimal rounding format established in Q13, now applied to finding a missing leg instead of hypotenuse.
- Good variety: alternating between finding different sides of the triangle while maintaining the decimal rounding requirement.
- The Phoenix/Edgeworth narrative dynamic is fitting for the courtroom investigation theme.
- The intermediate value shown (7.14) helps clarify the rounding decision to 1 decimal place.
- Good pedagogical reinforcement: reinforces that the same rounding rules apply regardless of which side is being calculated.
- This question continues the solid progression of the decimal approximation section of the question bank.
