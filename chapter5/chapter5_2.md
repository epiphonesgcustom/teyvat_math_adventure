## Question 2

**Source:** Exercise 5A - Question 1b - Page 93

**Question Text:** "The witness found evidence at a triangular location. The perpendicular sides measure 6 cm and 8 cm. Calculate the hypotenuse in surd form."

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** 10

**Explanation Provided:**
- Step 1: c² = 6² + 8²
- Step 2: c² = 36 + 64 = 100
- Step 3: c = √100 = 10 cm
- This is a perfect Pythagorean triple: 6-8-10!

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- The question is good and tests understanding of Pythagorean theorem with a perfect square result.
- Consider clarifying in the question that "surd form" includes integer answers (when the square root simplifies to a whole number). The answer "10" works, but the wording "surd form" might confuse some players who expect answers like "√100" or "√100 = 10".
- Nice narrative flavor with "witness found evidence" - good continuity from Question 1.
- The note about the 6-8-10 Pythagorean triple is educational and adds value.
