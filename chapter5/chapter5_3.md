## Question 3

**Source:** Exercise 5A - Question 1c - Page 93

**Question Text:** "Prosecutor Edgeworth examined a map of the crime scene. The two perpendicular roads measure 13 km and 8 km. Find the diagonal distance across in surd form."

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** √233

**Explanation Provided:**
- Step 1: c² = 13² + 8²
- Step 2: c² = 169 + 64 = 233
- Step 3: c = √233 km
- 233 is prime, so this is already in simplest surd form.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Good progression from previous questions with larger numbers and a prime result.
- Excellent note about 233 being prime, which educates players on why the surd cannot be simplified further.
- The scenario with Prosecutor Edgeworth examining crime scene roads adds to the narrative.
- The question and answer mechanism continue to work well.
