## Question 33

**Source:** Exercise 5D - Question 1d - Page 102

**Question Text:** "Pearl found a triangle with sides 3 cm, √7 cm, and √12 cm. Is it right-angled? Answer "yes" or "no"."

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** no

**Explanation Provided:**
- Step 1: Longest: √12 cm
- Step 2: Check: (√12)² = 3² + (√7)²?
- Step 3: 12 ≠ 9 + 7
- Step 4: 12 ≠ 16
- Not a right triangle!

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Excellent progression! This introduces verification with surd values, adding significant complexity and algebraic sophistication.
- Outstanding pedagogical value: requires squaring surds correctly ((√12)² = 12) and working with mixed radical and integer forms.
- The explanation's comment "Close, but not quite!" is excellent encouragement—12 is indeed close to 16, making this a good test of precision.
- Good variety: introduces surds into the verification section, testing mastery across multiple mathematical domains.
- Pearl Fey's character discovery of near-right triangles fits her investigative role well.
- The numbers (3, √7 ≈ 2.65, √12 ≈ 3.46) create a plausible-seeming triangle that fails verification only by careful calculation.
- This naturally bridges the verification section into more sophisticated mathematical territory with surds.
