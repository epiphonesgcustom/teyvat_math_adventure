## Question 31

**Source:** Exercise 5D - Question 1b - Page 102

**Question Text:** "Trucy asks: Is a triangle with sides 9 cm, 12 cm, and 15 cm right-angled? Answer "yes" or "no"."

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** yes

**Explanation Provided:**

* Step 1: Longest side is 15 cm
* Step 2: Check: 15² = 9² + 12²?
* Step 3: 225 = 81 + 144
* Step 4: 225 = 225 ✓
* This is the 3-4-5 triple scaled by 3!

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

* Excellent follow-up to Q30: provides positive verification after a negative example, showing both yes and no cases.
* Outstanding pedagogical value: the 9-12-15 triple is recognizable as 3-4-5 scaled, so students can verify by either calculation or pattern recognition.
* The explanation clearly identifies this as a scaled 3-4-5 triple, reinforcing the connection to earlier material.
* Good pairing with Q31: both use yes/no verification but with opposite results, testing thorough understanding.
* Trucy's character maintains narrative continuity while presenting accessible verification problems.
* The perfect equality (225 = 225) provides satisfying confirmation after the inequality in Q31.
* This naturally progresses the verification section with a recognizable example.
