## Question 36

**Source:** Exercise 5C - Question 19 - Page 100

**Question Text:** "Edgeworth presents a cube-shaped evidence box with sides of 3 cm. Find the length of the space diagonal (from one corner to the opposite corner through the interior) in simplest surd form."

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** 3√3

**Explanation Provided:**
- Step 1: Find face diagonal: d² = 3² + 3² = 18, so d = √18 = 3√2 cm
- Step 2: Use face diagonal and height for space diagonal:
- Step 3: D² = (3√2)² + 3²
- Step 4: D² = 18 + 9 = 27
- Step 5: D = √27 = 3√3 cm
- This is a 3D application of the Pythagorean theorem!

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Outstanding capstone question! This is a brilliant 3D application of the Pythagorean theorem, elevating the entire chapter's significance.
- Excellent pedagogical value: requires applying Pythagorean theorem twice—once for a face diagonal, then again for the space diagonal.
- The explanation clearly shows both applications, though Step 2's description "Use face diagonal and height" could be slightly more explicit about the second triangle being formed.
- Outstanding mathematical insight: this demonstrates how Pythagorean theorem extends beyond simple 2D problems into 3D geometry.
- Edgeworth's character presenting an evidence box with a complex 3D challenge perfectly fits his meticulous, advanced problem-solving persona.
- The progression from simple 2D problems to this 3D challenge represents excellent curriculum design and closure.
- The comment "This is a 3D application of the Pythagorean theorem!" excellently emphasizes the broader significance of the theorem.
- This question naturally serves as the penultimate challenge before the chapter conclusion.
