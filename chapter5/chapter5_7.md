## Question 7

**Source:** Exercise 5A - Question 2a - Page 93

**Question Text:** "Detective Gumshoe measured a piece of evidence. One side is 6 cm and the hypotenuse is 11 cm. Find the length of the unknown side in surd form."

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** √85

**Explanation Provided:**
- Step 1: Use a² + b² = c², rearrange to a² = c² - b²
- Step 2: a² = 11² - 6²
- Step 3: a² = 121 - 36 = 85
- Step 4: a = √85 cm

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Excellent progression! This switches from finding the hypotenuse to finding a missing leg.
- The rearrangement of the Pythagorean theorem is clearly explained, which helps students understand the flexibility of the formula.
- Good pedagogical step to introduce this variation after mastering hypotenuse calculations.
- Detective Gumshoe's character fits well with the evidence examination narrative.
- 85 = 5 × 17, both prime, so the surd cannot be simplified further—good choice.
