## Question 11

**Source:** Exercise 5A - Question 2e - Page 93

**Question Text:** "Trucy found evidence in her magic hat. The hypotenuse is 6.3 m and one side is 3.7 m. Find the unknown side in surd form."

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** √26

**Explanation Provided:**
- Step 1: a² = 6.3² - 3.7²
- Step 2: a² = 39.69 - 13.69 = 26
- Step 3: a = √26 m

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Excellent progression introducing decimal numbers into Pythagorean theorem problems.
- This question tests students' ability to work with decimals and understand that the underlying math remains the same regardless of number format.
- Good choice of values (6.3 and 3.7) that result in clean arithmetic (39.69 - 13.69 = 26) without calculator reliance.
- The narrative with Trucy finding evidence in her magic hat maintains thematic consistency with her character.
- The question naturally reinforces that surds work with decimal inputs just as they do with integers.
- Note: The explanation could benefit from showing that 26 cannot be simplified further (26 = 2 × 13, both prime), though this is implied.
