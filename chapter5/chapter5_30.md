## Question 30

**Source:** Exercise 5D - Question 1a - Page 102

**Question Text:** "Apollo needs to verify if a triangle with sides 7 cm, 4 cm, and 5 cm is right-angled. Enter "yes" if it is, "no" if it isn't."

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** no

**Explanation Provided:**

* Step 1: Identify longest side: 7 cm (would be hypotenuse)
* Step 2: Check: 7² = 4² + 5²?
* Step 3: 49 ≠ 16 + 25
* Step 4: 49 ≠ 41
* This triangle does NOT satisfy the Pythagorean theorem!

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

* Excellent transition! This marks a new section (Exercise 5D) focusing on triangle classification and verification.
* Outstanding pedagogical value: shifts from construction to verification, testing whether students can apply Pythagorean theorem backwards.
* The yes/no format is clearer than expected, making the question accessible while testing conceptual understanding.
* The explanation clearly shows the logical process: identify longest side, test the equality, discover it fails.
* Good pedagogical sequence: the numbers are close enough (49 vs 41) that students can't rely on intuition and must calculate.
* Apollo Justice's character continues the verification/investigation narrative theme well.
* This question naturally bridges from direct calculation to theorem application and triangle classification.
