## Question 28

**Source:** Exercise 5B - Question 3e - Page 97

**Question Text:** "Franziska whips out {20, k, k+8}. The hypotenuse is k+8. Find k!"

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** 21

**Explanation Provided:**

* Step 1: 20² + k² = (k+8)²
* Step 2: 400 + k² = k² + 16k + 64
* Step 3: 400 = 16k + 64
* Step 4: 336 = 16k
* Step 5: k = 21
* Triple: {20, 21, 29}

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

* Excellent continuation of algebraic triple-finding with a larger coefficient (k+8 instead of k+2).
* Good pedagogical progression: the algebra is slightly more complex (16k instead of 4k), requiring more careful computation.
* The identification of the resulting triple {20, 21, 29} is excellent educational reinforcement.
* Note: 20-21-29 is not a well-known scaled triple; it's actually a primitive triple, which is valuable for showing variety in Pythagorean triples.
* Franziska's enthusiastic "whips out" narrative maintains character engagement while presenting challenging algebraic content.
* The larger numbers (336 = 16k) test computational confidence and arithmetic accuracy.
* Good reinforcement of algebraic problem-solving skills within the Pythagorean theorem context.
