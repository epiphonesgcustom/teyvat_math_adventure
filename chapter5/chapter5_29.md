## Question 29

**Source:** Exercise 5B - Question 3f - Page 97

**Question Text:** "Godot challenges you with {k, 60, k+50}. The hypotenuse is k+50. Find k."

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** 11

**Explanation Provided:**

* Step 1: k² + 60² = (k+50)²
* Step 2: k² + 3600 = k² + 100k + 2500
* Step 3: 3600 = 100k + 2500
* Step 4: 1100 = 100k
* Step 5: k = 11
* Triple: {11, 60, 61}

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

* Excellent challenge question with even larger coefficients (k+50) than previous algebraic problems.
* Wonderful pedagogical moment: This rediscovers the famous 11-60-61 Pythagorean triple from Q26, showing the connection between triple identification and algebraic problem-solving.
* Good narrative payoff: Godot "challenges" the player, and the challenge demonstrates the beauty of mathematical relationships (same triple discovered two different ways).
* The algebra is slightly more complex (100k instead of 16k), requiring careful computation.
* The identification of the resulting triple {11, 60, 61} provides excellent educational reinforcement and connects to earlier material.
* This represents a natural capstone to the algebraic triple section, combining large coefficients with familiar triple recognition.
* Godot's character fits well with presenting complex challenges that have elegant solutions.
