## Question 34

**Source:** Exercise 5D - Question 1e - Page 102

**Question Text:** "The court examines a triangle: √27 m, √48 m, and √75 m. Is this right-angled? Answer "yes" or "no"."

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** yes

**Explanation Provided:**

* Step 1: Longest: √75 m
* Step 2: Check: (√75)² = (√27)² + (√48)²?
* Step 3: 75 = 27 + 48
* Step 4: 75 = 75 ✓
* This satisfies the Pythagorean theorem!

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

* Excellent capstone to the verification section: shows a positive surd example with a beautiful underlying structure.
* Outstanding pedagogical value: the hidden 3-4-5 relationship (√27 = 3√3, √48 = 4√3, √75 = 5√3) teaches deep mathematical insight.
* The explanation's direct verification is clean and satisfying, but could optionally note the 3-4-5 relationship for educational enrichment.
* Good pacing within the surd verification: Q34 was a near-miss, Q35 is a perfect example, showing variety and reinforcing precision.
* Judge's character examining in court maintains the authoritative narrative voice well for verification problems.
* The perfect equality (75 = 75) provides satisfying confirmation and mathematical beauty.
* This naturally culminates the verification section with sophisticated surd manipulation and recognition of underlying patterns.
