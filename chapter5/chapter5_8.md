## Question 8

**Source:** Exercise 5A - Question 2b - Page 93

**Question Text:** "Godot is investigating evidence at the scene. The hypotenuse measures 17 m and one side is 15 m. Find the unknown side in surd form."

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** 8

**Explanation Provided:**
- Step 1: a² = 17² - 15²
- Step 2: a² = 289 - 225 = 64
- Step 3: a = √64 = 8 m
- This is the Pythagorean triple 8-15-17!

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Excellent choice of a Pythagorean triple with a perfect square result after rearrangement.
- Nice variety in question types: some yield irrational surds, this one yields a rational integer result.
- The explanation correctly identifies the 8-15-17 triple, which is educational for players.
- Godot's character narrative fits the investigation theme.
- Good pedagogical balance after Q7's unsimplifiable surd.
