## Question 12

**Source:** Exercise 5A - Question 2f - Page 93

**Question Text:** "Klavier measured backstage evidence: one side is 75 cm and the hypotenuse is 1.95 m. Find the unknown side. Give your answer in cm."

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** 180

**Explanation Provided:**
- Step 1: Convert: 1.95 m = 195 cm
- Step 2: a² = 195² - 75²
- Step 3: a² = 38025 - 5625 = 32400
- Step 4: a = √32400 = 180 cm
- This is actually a scaled version of the 5-12-13 Pythagorean triple (×15)!

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Excellent question combining unit conversion (meters to centimeters) with a larger scale calculation.
- The explanation correctly identifies the scaled Pythagorean triple relationship (75-180-195 = 5-12-13 × 15), which is educational for players.
- Good progression from Q11—continues the decimal/unit conversion theme with even larger numbers.
- The result is a perfect square (180), which provides nice variety after Q11's irrational surd.
- Klavier Gavin's backstage evidence narrative adds character variety to the question set.
- This question effectively reinforces that Pythagorean relationships scale proportionally, a key insight for deep understanding.
