## Question 5

**Source:** Exercise 5A - Question 1e - Page 93

**Question Text:** "Franziska measured the crime scene with her whip. The perpendicular measurements are 12 m and 10 m. Calculate the diagonal in surd form."

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** 2√61

**Explanation Provided:**
- Step 1: c² = 12² + 10²
- Step 2: c² = 144 + 100 = 244
- Step 3: c = √244
- Step 4: Simplify: √244 = √(4×61) = 2√61 m

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Excellent question with a slightly more complex simplification requiring students to factor out 4 from 244.
- The character narrative with Franziska's whip is fun and thematically appropriate.
- Good continuous progression building difficulty and complexity of surd simplification.
- Questions are well-paced and pedagogically sound.
