## Question 32

**Source:** Exercise 5D - Question 1c - Page 102

**Question Text:** "Klavier rocks out with sides 5 cm, 9 cm, and 8 cm. Is this a right triangle? Answer "yes" or "no"."

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** no

**Explanation Provided:**

* Step 1: Longest side: 9 cm
* Step 2: Check: 9² = 5² + 8²?
* Step 3: 81 ≠ 25 + 64
* Step 4: 81 ≠ 89
* This doesn't satisfy Pythagoras!

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

* Good continuation of the triangle verification pattern with a non-right triangle.
* The numbers (5, 8, 9) are close to forming a valid triangle but just miss (81 vs 89), requiring careful calculation.
* Klavier's enthusiastic "rocks out" maintains character engagement throughout the verification section.
* The explanation clearly shows the mismatch, reinforcing the necessity of exact verification rather than estimation.
* Good variety: after Q32's positive example and Q31's negative example, Q33 provides another negative case with different numbers.
* The 8-unit difference (89 vs 81) is significant enough to catch with calculation but subtle enough to prevent guessing.
* This naturally progresses the verification section with increasingly varied triangle characteristics.
