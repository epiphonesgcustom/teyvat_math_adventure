## Question 10

**Source:** Exercise 5A - Question 2d - Page 93

**Question Text:** "Larry claims he measured a right triangle with base 21 cm and hypotenuse 18 cm. Find the height to expose the contradiction! (Hint: Check if this is even possible!)"

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** impossible

**Explanation Provided:**
- The hypotenuse (18 cm) cannot be shorter than one of the sides (21 cm).
- In any right triangle, the hypotenuse is always the longest side.
- Larry's testimony is clearly false!

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Excellent pedagogical choice! This tests conceptual understanding rather than just calculation skills.
- The question naturally fits the Ace Attorney theme of exposing contradictions in testimony.
- The hint "Check if this is even possible!" is helpful without giving away the answer completely.
- This question reinforces a fundamental property of right triangles that students often take for granted.
- Great narrative fit with Larry Butz's character (known for being unreliable/making mistakes).
- Consider: The question asks to "Find the height" but the answer is "impossible"—the interface correctly accepts this, but some players might struggle with understanding that "impossible" is a valid answer format. The explanation helps clarify this well.
