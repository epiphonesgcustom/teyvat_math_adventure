## Question 19

**Source:** Exercise 5A - Question 4a - Page 93

**Question Text:** "Godot presents evidence: a triangle with hypotenuse 3 cm, one side √2 cm, and unknown side x cm. Find x in surd form."

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** √7

**Explanation Provided:**
- Step 1: x² + (√2)² = 3²
- Step 2: x² + 2 = 9
- Step 3: x² = 7
- Step 4: x = √7 cm

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Excellent transition! This marks a significant shift back to surd answers after the decimal rounding section, creating natural curriculum progression.
- Outstanding pedagogical choice: introduces surds in the given values (√2), requiring students to work with surds throughout the calculation, not just in the answer.
- The step-by-step explanation clearly shows (√2)² = 2, reinforcing important surd arithmetic rules (squaring a square root).
- Godot as a character presenting evidence continues the thematic consistency.
- Good difficulty level: simple enough to follow but requires confidence working with surds as intermediate values.
- 7 is prime, so √7 is already in simplest form - a clean result that reinforces surd simplification understanding.
- This question naturally bridges the decimal approximation section back to exact surd answers, creating a narrative arc in the curriculum.
