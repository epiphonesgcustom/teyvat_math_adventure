## Question 6

**Source:** Exercise 5A - Question 1f - Page 93

**Question Text:** "Pearl measured a small piece of evidence: one side is 9 mm and the other is 2 cm. Find the hypotenuse in surd form. Give your answer in mm."

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** √481

**Explanation Provided:**
- Step 1: Convert units: 2 cm = 20 mm
- Step 2: c² = 9² + 20²
- Step 3: c² = 81 + 400 = 481
- Step 4: c = √481 mm
- 481 is prime, so this is in simplest form.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Excellent question adding unit conversion challenge, which is a practical real-world skill.
- Good that the explanation explicitly shows the unit conversion step, helping players understand the necessity and process.
- The 9-20-√481 relationship introduces a new element (9-20 is close to a Pythagorean triple but not exact: 9-40-41 is one, 20-21-29 is one).
- Pearl Fey's character narrative about examining evidence fits the detective story theme well.
