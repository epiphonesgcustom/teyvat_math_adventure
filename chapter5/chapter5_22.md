## Question 22

**Source:** Exercise 5A - Question 4d - Page 93

**Question Text:** "Klavier rocks the courtroom with evidence: sides 2√2 cm and 3√3 cm. Find hypotenuse x in surd form."

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** √35

**Explanation Provided:**
- Step 1: x² = (2√2)² + (3√3)²
- Step 2: x² = 4×2 + 9×3
- Step 3: x² = 8 + 27 = 35
- Step 4: x = √35 cm

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Excellent challenge question with coefficient surds: requires understanding (a√b)² = a²b, a critical surd algebra skill.
- Outstanding pedagogical progression: this represents a genuine step up in difficulty, requiring confident manipulation of surd expressions with coefficients.
- The step-by-step explanation clearly shows the expansion process: (2√2)² = 4×2 = 8, reinforcing the algebra rule.
- Good variety in the surd bases (√2 and √3) prevents pattern recognition and requires genuine understanding.
- Klavier's enthusiastic narrative ("rocks the courtroom") maintains character engagement while presenting a challenging problem.
- 35 = 5×7 (both prime), so √35 is in simplest form - a satisfying algebraic result.
- This question naturally represents the highest complexity level of Pythagorean calculations with surds, testing full mastery of the skill set.
