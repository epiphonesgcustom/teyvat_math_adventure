## Question 24

**Source:** Exercise 5B - Question 3a - Page 97

**Question Text:** "Phoenix needs to find the missing value! Given the Pythagorean triple {12, 16, k}, find k."

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** 20

**Explanation Provided:**

* Step 1: Identify that k must be the hypotenuse (largest value)
* Step 2: k² = 12² + 16²
* Step 3: k² = 144 + 256 = 400
* Step 4: k = √400 = 20
* This is the famous 3-4-5 triple scaled by 4!

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

* Excellent transition! This marks a shift to a new section (Exercise 5B) and introduces Pythagorean triple identification without surds.
* Outstanding pedagogical value: requires recognizing that k is the hypotenuse and understanding Pythagorean triples as a concept.
* The explanation explicitly names this as a scaled 3-4-5 triple, which is excellent pattern recognition education.
* Step 1 of the explanation (identifying k as the hypotenuse) is particularly valuable as it teaches logic before calculation.
* Good narrative: Phoenix returning as the central character for this new section maintains continuity.
* The clean result (√400 = 20) provides satisfying algebraic closure.
* This question naturally bridges from abstract Pythagorean theorem work to practical triple recognition, a valuable real-world skill.
