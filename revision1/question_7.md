# Question 7: Similar Triangles - Finding a Side

**Question ID:** rev13b_5a  
**Source:** Exercise REV13B - Question 5a - Page 272  
**Question Number:** 10/12

### Question Text
Pearl has two similar triangles UVZ and XYZ sharing vertex Z. Triangle UVZ has sides: UV=10cm, VZ=5cm. Triangle XYZ has sides: YZ=8cm, XZ=x cm. The triangles share angle θ at Z. Find x.

### Result
✅ **OBJECTION SUSTAINED (Correct)**

**My Answer:** 16 cm  
**Correct Answer:** 16 cm

### Solution Verification
I solved this independently:
- The triangles are similar, so corresponding sides are proportional
- Angle θ is at vertex Z in both triangles
- In triangle UVZ: sides adjacent to Z are VZ=5cm and UV=10cm
- In triangle XYZ: sides adjacent to Z are YZ=8cm and XZ=x cm
- Setting up proportion: VZ/YZ = UV/XZ
- 5/8 = 10/x
- Cross multiply: 5x = 80
- **x = 16 cm** ✓

### Suggestions for Improvement

1. **Clear Problem Statement:** The question clearly identifies which sides correspond and which angle is shared, making the similarity relationship obvious.

2. **Good Similarity Application:** The problem effectively tests understanding of similar triangles and proportional sides.

3. **Appropriate Difficulty:** For a geometry problem on similar triangles, this is appropriately challenging but solvable with proper setup.

4. **Positive Note:** Well-constructed problem with clear parameters and a definitive answer.

**Overall Assessment:** This is a well-designed, mathematically sound problem. No improvements needed.
