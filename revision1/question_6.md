# Question 6: Right Triangle Perimeter Formula

**Question ID:** rev1_8a3_b  
**Source:** Exercise REV8A - Question 3b - Page 162  
**Question Number:** 6/12

### Question Text
Franziska presents a right triangle with legs a cm and (a+5) cm. Write a formula for the perimeter P in terms of a.

### Result
✅ **OBJECTION SUSTAINED (Correct)**

**My Answer:** 2a + 5 + √(2a² + 10a + 25)  
**Correct Answer:** P = 2a + 5 + √(2a² + 10a + 25)

### Solution Verification
I solved this independently:
- Given: Right triangle with legs a cm and (a+5) cm
- By Pythagorean theorem: hypotenuse² = a² + (a+5)²
  - h² = a² + a² + 10a + 25
  - h² = 2a² + 10a + 25
  - h = √(2a² + 10a + 25)
- Perimeter = a + (a+5) + √(2a² + 10a + 25)
- **P = 2a + 5 + √(2a² + 10a + 25)** ✓

### Suggestions for Improvement

1. **Excellent Algebraic Problem:** This is a challenging and well-designed problem that combines Pythagorean theorem with algebraic formula writing. It's appropriately difficult for a review question.

2. **Clear Solution:** The step-by-step breakdown is excellent:
   - Shows the application of Pythagorean theorem
   - Demonstrates proper expansion of (a+5)²
   - Correctly simplifies to final formula
   - Shows the complete perimeter formula

3. **Good Progression:** This question appropriately follows the simpler formula question (Q5), showing increasing complexity and rigor.

4. **Positive Note:** This is one of the strongest questions - it effectively assesses student understanding of multiple concepts (Pythagorean theorem, algebraic expansion, formula construction).

5. **No Diagram Needed:** While a diagram might help visualization, it's not essential for solving this algebraic problem.

**Overall Assessment:** This is an excellent question that is mathematically sound, clearly stated, and well-explained. No improvements needed.
