# Question 1: Composite Figure Perimeter

**Question ID:** rev1_8a1_a  
**Source:** Exercise REV8A - Question 1a - Page 162  
**Question Number:** 1/12

### Question Text
Phoenix examines a composite figure shaped like a rectangle with rectangular cutouts. The outer dimensions are 12 m tall, with a base of 6 m and a top section of 3 m wide. Find the perimeter (in m).

### Result
✅ **OBJECTION SUSTAINED (Correct)**

**My Answer:** 42 m  
**Correct Answer:** 42 m  
**Acceptable Answers:** 42, 42 m, 42m

### Solution Verification
I solved this independently before checking the answer:
- Visualized an L-shaped composite figure
- Left side: 12 m (full height)
- Bottom: 6 m (full width)
- Right side has a step: 3 m up + 3 m across (inward) + 9 m up
- Top: 3 m
- Left step down: 3 m
- **Total: 12 + 6 + 3 + 3 + 9 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 42 m** ✓

### Suggestions for Improvement

1. **Visual Diagram Critical:** The dashed box area where a diagram should appear is empty. This is a geometry problem where visualization is essential. Without seeing the actual shape, students must guess the configuration from the text description. **STRONGLY RECOMMEND adding a clear SVG or image diagram of the composite figure.** This would dramatically improve clarity and reduce ambiguity.

2. **Ambiguous Description:** The phrase "rectangle with rectangular cutouts" with "a top section of 3 m wide" requires the student to infer that this is an L-shaped figure. More explicit phrasing would help: "an L-shaped composite figure with..." or "a rectangular figure with a rectangular notch cut from the upper right."

3. **Multiple Interpretations Possible:** Without the diagram, students could interpret this as various configurations (steps on different sides, centered cuts, etc.). The diagram is essential to prevent multiple valid but unintended solutions.

4. **Positive Note:** The solution feedback is excellent! The step-by-step breakdown clearly shows how to decompose the L-shape perimeter and trace around all edges. This is very helpful for learning.
