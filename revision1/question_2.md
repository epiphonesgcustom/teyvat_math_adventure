# Question 2: Isosceles Triangle Perimeter

**Question ID:** rev1_8a1_b  
**Source:** Exercise REV8A - Question 1b - Page 162  
**Question Number:** 2/12

### Question Text
Maya found an isosceles triangle with two equal sides of 92 mm each and a base angle of 45°. Find the perimeter (in mm, to 1 decimal place).

### Result
✅ **OBJECTION SUSTAINED (Correct)**

**My Answer:** 314.1 mm  
**Correct Answer:** 314.1 mm  
**Acceptable Answers:** 314.1, 314, 314.1 mm

### Solution Verification
I solved this independently:
- Given: Two equal sides = 92 mm, base angle = 45°
- Since base angles are 45° each, apex angle = 180° - 45° - 45° = 90°
- This is a 45-45-90 right isosceles triangle
- Base = 92√2 ≈ 130.1 mm
- **Perimeter = 92 + 92 + 130.1 ≈ 314.1 mm** ✓

### Suggestions for Improvement

1. **Excellent Clarity:** This question is well-written. The description "isosceles triangle with two equal sides of 92 mm each and a base angle of 45°" is clear and unambiguous. No confusion about which sides or angles are being referred to.

2. **Missing Diagram:** While not as critical as for composite figures, a simple triangle diagram would still help visualization, especially for students learning these concepts.

3. **Good Solution Format:** The step-by-step solution correctly identifies this as a 45-45-90 triangle and uses the proper formula (92√2 for the hypotenuse). The pedagogical approach is sound.

4. **Positive Note:** The question properly specifies "to 1 decimal place" which sets clear precision expectations, and the acceptable answers reflect reasonable rounding variants (314.1 and 314).

**Overall Assessment:** This question is well-constructed with good clarity. The answer is mathematically correct and the solution is clearly explained.
