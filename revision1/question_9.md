# Question 9 (Final): Similar Triangles with Quadratic Equation

**Question ID:** rev13b_5c  
**Source:** Exercise REV13B - Question 5c - Page 272  
**Question Number:** 9/9 (FINAL)

### Question Text
Oldbag shows two similar triangles IJK and ILM. In triangle IJK: JK=x m, IK=(3x-2) m. In triangle ILM: LM=(2x-3) m, IM=x m. Find x.

### Result
✅ **OBJECTION SUSTAINED (Correct)**

**My Answer:** 2 m  
**Correct Answer:** 2 m

### Solution Verification
I solved this independently:
- Similar triangles: JK/LM = IK/IM
- x/(2x-3) = (3x-2)/x
- Cross multiply: x² = (3x-2)(2x-3)
- Expand: x² = 6x² - 9x - 4x + 6
- x² = 6x² - 13x + 6
- 0 = 5x² - 13x + 6
- Quadratic formula: x = (13 ± √(169-120))/10 = (13 ± 7)/10
- **Solutions: x = 2 or x = 0.6** ✓

### Side Length Verification
With x = 2:
- Triangle IJK: JK=2m, IK=4m
- Triangle ILM: LM=1m, IM=2m
- Proportion check: 2/1 = 4/2 = 2 ✓ **SIMILAR!**
- All sides positive ✓

With x = 0.6 (rejected):
- Triangle ILM: LM = 2(0.6) - 3 = -1.8m (negative) ✗

### Suggestions for Improvement

1. **✓ FIXED: Answer corrected!** The quadratic roots now correctly show x = 2 or x = 0.6, and x = 2 is verified as the valid solution.

2. **Clear multi-step problem:** This is an excellent challenging question that combines:
   - Similar triangle proportions
   - Cross multiplication
   - Quadratic equation solving
   - Solution validation (checking for positive side lengths)

3. **Appropriate difficulty:** Perfect for a comprehensive geometry/algebra review as the final question.

4. **Complete solution:** The step-by-step breakdown is clear and mathematically sound.

**Overall Assessment:** This is now a well-constructed, mathematically correct problem. Excellent fit as the capstone question for the revision test.
