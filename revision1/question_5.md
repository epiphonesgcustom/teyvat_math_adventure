# Question 5: Trapezoid Perimeter Formula

**Question ID:** rev1_8a3_a  
**Source:** Exercise REV8A - Question 3a - Page 162  
**Question Number:** 5/12

### Question Text
Apollo needs a formula for the perimeter of a trapezoid with parallel sides (x+1) m and 2x m, and equal slanted sides x m each. Write the formula in simplest form.

### Result
✅ **OBJECTION SUSTAINED (Correct)**

**My Answer:** 5x + 1  
**Correct Answer:** 5x + 1

### Solution Verification
I solved this independently:
- Perimeter = sum of all four sides
- P = (x+1) + 2x + x + x
- P = x + 1 + 2x + x + x
- **P = 5x + 1** ✓

### Suggestions for Improvement

1. **Clear Algebraic Problem:** This is a good algebraic thinking problem that requires students to combine like terms. The problem is clearly stated and unambiguous.

2. **Good Scaffolding:** The solution shows the step-by-step process of writing out all terms, then combining like terms, which demonstrates good algebraic practice.

3. **Appropriate Difficulty:** For a question asking students to write formulas, this is appropriately challenging - not trivial but solvable with basic algebraic skills.

4. **No Diagram Needed:** This is a pure algebra problem, so no diagram is necessary.

5. **Positive Note:** This is a well-constructed algebraic problem with a clear solution. The question transitions from numerical problems to algebraic thinking, which is good pedagogical progression.

**Overall Assessment:** This question is well-designed and correct. No improvements needed.
