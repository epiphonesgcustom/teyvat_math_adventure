# Question 3: Trapezoid Area

**Question ID:** rev1_8a1_c  
**Source:** Exercise REV8A - Question 1c - Page 162  
**Question Number:** 3/12

### Question Text
Edgeworth presents a trapezoid with parallel sides of 2 m (top) and 3.6 m (bottom), and equal slanted sides of 1.7 m each. Find the area (in m², to 1 decimal place).

### Result
✅ **OBJECTION SUSTAINED (Correct)**

**My Answer:** 4.2 m²  
**Correct Answer:** 4.2 m²  
**Acceptable Answers:** 4.2, 4.2 m², 4.18

### Solution Verification
I solved this independently:
- Parallel sides: a = 2 m (top), b = 3.6 m (bottom)
- Slanted sides: 1.7 m each (isosceles trapezoid)
- Overhang on each side: (3.6 - 2) / 2 = 0.8 m
- Using Pythagorean theorem: h² + 0.8² = 1.7²
  - h² = 2.89 - 0.64 = 2.25
  - h = 1.5 m
- **Area = ½ × (2 + 3.6) × 1.5 = ½ × 5.6 × 1.5 = 4.2 m²** ✓

### Suggestions for Improvement

1. **✓ FIXED: Mathematical Consistency Restored.** The answer now correctly matches the calculation! The corrected answer of 4.2 m² is mathematically sound and consistent with the problem parameters.

2. **Visual Diagram Recommended:** While the problem works well numerically, a diagram of the trapezoid showing the parallel sides, slanted sides, and height would help students visualize the geometry and verify their approach before calculating.

3. **Clear Solution:** The step-by-step breakdown is excellent, showing:
   - How to find the height from the overhang and slanted side
   - Application of Pythagorean theorem
   - Proper application of trapezoid area formula

4. **Acceptable Answers:** The question appropriately accepts 4.18 as an alternative, showing flexibility for rounding variants during intermediate calculations.

**Overall Assessment:** This is now a well-constructed, mathematically sound problem. The fix resolved the inconsistency and made this question reliable for assessment.
