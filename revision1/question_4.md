# Question 4: Tire Revolutions

**Question ID:** rev1_8a2  
**Source:** Exercise REV8A - Question 2 - Page 162  
**Question Number:** 4/12

### Question Text
Detective Gumshoe investigates a car with tires that have a diameter of 50 cm. How many complete revolutions do the tires make when the car travels 2 km? (Round to nearest whole number)

### Result
✅ **OBJECTION SUSTAINED (Correct)**

**My Answer:** 1273 revolutions  
**Correct Answer:** 1273 revolutions  
**Acceptable Answers:** 1273, 1273 revolutions, 1274

### Solution Verification
I solved this independently:
- Tire diameter: 50 cm
- Circumference = πd = π × 50 ≈ 157.08 cm
- Distance traveled: 2 km = 200,000 cm
- Revolutions = Distance / Circumference = 200,000 / 157.08 ≈ 1273.2
- **Rounded to nearest whole number: 1273 revolutions** ✓

### Suggestions for Improvement

1. **Excellent Problem:** This is a well-constructed, real-world application problem with clear parameters and practical relevance.

2. **Clear Solution:** The step-by-step solution is excellent, showing all unit conversions (2 km = 200,000 cm) and the proper formula application.

3. **Good Rounding Guidance:** The question specifies "Round to nearest whole number" which sets clear expectations. The acceptable answers appropriately include 1274 as an alternative rounding variant, showing flexibility.

4. **No Diagram Needed:** Unlike the geometry problems, this problem doesn't require a diagram - the description is sufficient.

5. **Positive Note:** This is one of the strongest questions in the set. It's clear, mathematically sound, and pedagogically effective.

**Overall Assessment:** This question is well-designed and correct. No improvements needed.
