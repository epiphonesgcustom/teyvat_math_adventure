# Question 8: Similar Triangles - Side Proportion

**Question ID:** rev13b_5b  
**Source:** Exercise REV13B - Question 5b - Page 272  
**Question Number:** 11/12

### Question Text
Godot presents two similar triangles ABC and ADE. In triangle ABC: BC=3cm, AB=5cm. In triangle ADE: DE=8cm, AD=x cm. Find x.

### Result
✅ **OBJECTION SUSTAINED (Correct)**

**My Answer:** 40/3 cm  
**Correct Answer:** 40/3 cm ≈ 13.33 cm

### Solution Verification
I solved this independently:
- The triangles are similar, so corresponding sides are proportional
- Both triangles share vertex A
- Proportion: AB/AD = BC/DE
- 5/x = 3/8
- Cross multiply: 3x = 40
- **x = 40/3 ≈ 13.33 cm** ✓

### Suggestions for Improvement

1. **Clear Problem Setup:** The problem clearly identifies which sides correspond between the similar triangles.

2. **Fraction Answer:** The question appropriately accepts the fractional form (40/3) as well as the decimal approximation (13.33 cm).

3. **Good Geometry Concept:** Effectively tests understanding of similar triangles and proportional sides.

4. **Positive Note:** Well-constructed problem with clear parameters.

**Overall Assessment:** This is a well-designed, mathematically sound problem. No improvements needed.
