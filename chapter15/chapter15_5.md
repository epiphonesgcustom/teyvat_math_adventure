## Question 5

**Source:** Exercise 15D - Question 1a - Page 305

**Question Text:** "Mia examines a right triangle with a hypotenuse of 9 cm and an opposite side of 6 cm. Find the angle θ (round to 1 decimal place)."

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** 41.8

**Explanation Provided:**
sin θ = 6/9 = 0.6667
θ = arcsin(0.6667) ≈ 41.8°

**Assessment:**

* Excellent clarity! This question specifies:

  * The hypotenuse (9 cm)
  * The opposite side (6 cm)
  * What to find (angle θ)
  * The relationship is unambiguous

**Pedagogical Strengths:**

* Clear problem specification
* Introduces inverse trigonometric functions (arcsin)
* Transition from finding sides to finding angles
* All relationships explicitly stated

**Mathematical Techniques:**

* Identifies correct ratio (sine for opposite/hypotenuse)
* Uses inverse sine to find angle
* Decimal approximation
* Demonstrates inverse trigonometric thinking
