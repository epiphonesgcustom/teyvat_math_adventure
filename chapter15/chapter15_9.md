## Question 9

**Source:** Exercise 15E - Question 1 - Page 307

**Question Text:** "Maya investigates a wheelchair ramp at a building entrance. The ramp is 5 meters long and rises 60 cm (0.6 m) in height. Find the angle θ that the ramp makes with the ground (round to 1 decimal place)."

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** 6.9°

**Explanation Provided:**
sin θ = 0.6/5 = 0.12
θ = arcsin(0.12) ≈ 6.9°

**Assessment:**

* Excellent real-world application!
* Clear specifications:

  * Ramp length = hypotenuse (5 m)
  * Height rise = opposite (0.6 m)
  * Angle to find = angle with ground
  * Relationship is unambiguous

**Pedagogical Strengths:**

* FIRST REAL-WORLD APPLICATION in Chapter 15
* Wheelchair ramp is practical, relevant scenario
* Shows trigonometry has actual uses
* Makes mathematics meaningful
* Small angle (6.9°) shows shallow ramp (accessibility standard)
* Bridges from abstract to concrete

**Mathematical Techniques:**

* Identifies correct ratio (sine for opposite/hypotenuse)
* Uses inverse sine function
* Unit conversion concept (60 cm = 0.6 m)
* Decimal approximation
* Real-world context application

**Real-World Connection:**

* Wheelchair ramps must have shallow angles for accessibility
* Standard ramp slope is typically 1:12 (≈ 4.8°)
* This question's 6.9° is slightly steeper but reasonable
* Shows importance of trigonometry in design

**Educational Value:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ EXCELLENT

* Transitions from pure math to applied math
* Demonstrates practical utility
* Engages real-world problem-solving
* Maintains mathematical rigor
