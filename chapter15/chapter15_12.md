## Question 12

**Source:** Exercise 15F - Question 7a - Page 313

**Question Text:** "Phoenix tracks a bushwalker who hikes from their starting point: 5.4 km east, 2.8 km north. Find the bearing of the campsite from the starting point (round to the nearest degree)."

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** 63°

**Explanation Provided:**
tan θ = 2.8/5.4 ≈ 0.5185
θ = arctan(0.5185) ≈ 27.4°
Bearing = 090° - 27.4° = 62.6° ≈ 062°
Alternatively: bearing from north = arctan(5.4/2.8) ≈ 62.6°

**Assessment:**

* Bearing calculation from Cartesian coordinates
* Clear specifications: 5.4 km east, 2.8 km north
* Tests bearing notation understanding
* Requires coordinate-to-bearing conversion
* Uses inverse tangent calculation
