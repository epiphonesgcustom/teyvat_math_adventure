# Question 8: Finding Angle with Simpler Ratio

**Question ID:** ch15_2a  
**Source:** Exercise 15D - Question 2a - Page 305  
**Question Number:** 8/14 (Chapter 15)

### Question Text
Phoenix needs to find all unknown sides and angles in a right triangle. The hypotenuse is 10 cm, the adjacent side to angle θ is 7 cm. Find angle θ (round to 1 decimal place).

### Result
✅ **OBJECTION SUSTAINED (Correct)**

**My Answer:** 45.6°  
**Correct Answer:** 45.6°

### Solution Verification
I solved this independently:
- Hypotenuse = 10 cm
- Adjacent side = 7 cm
- cos(θ) = adjacent / hypotenuse
- cos(θ) = 7 / 10 = 0.7
- θ = arccos(0.7) ≈ 45.57° ≈ 45.6° ✓

### Assessment

**Strengths:**
- Clean whole number ratio (7/10 = 0.7)
- Good follow-up to Q7
- Demonstrates consistent inverse cosine method
- Simpler numbers make calculation easier

**Overall:** Excellent reinforcement question with a cleaner ratio, showing consistent application of inverse trigonometric functions.
