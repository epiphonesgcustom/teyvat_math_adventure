## Question 1

**Source:** Exercise 15B - Question 1b - Page 301

**Question Text:** "Edgeworth analyzes a right triangle with sides 2 cm, 3 cm, and an angle θ. The right angle is at the bottom left, with the 2 cm side vertical and 3 cm side horizontal. Find cos θ (as a decimal to 2 decimal places)."

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** 0.83

**Explanation Provided:**
Hypotenuse = √(2² + 3²) = √13 ≈ 3.61 cm
cos θ = adjacent/hypotenuse = 3/3.61 ≈ 0.83

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

* Good improvement! Q2 is much clearer geometrically than Q1.
* Excellent pedagogical value: clearly specifies the triangle's configuration and which sides are vertical/horizontal.
* The explanation shows: use Pythagorean theorem to find hypotenuse, then apply cos θ = adjacent/hypotenuse.
* The clear geometric specification makes this question unambiguous.
* Edgeworth's analytical character suits trigonometric problem-solving.
* The problem teaches how to identify adjacent vs opposite sides relative to an angle.

**Pedagogical Strengths:**

* Clear triangle specification
* Pythagorean theorem application
* Cosine ratio definition
* Adjacent side identification
* Hypotenuse calculation
* Decimal approximation
