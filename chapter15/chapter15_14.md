## Question 14

**Source:** Exercise 15F - Question 8b - Page 313

**Question Text:** "Maya helps the kayaker return home. The kayaker paddled: 3.1 km south, 1.6 km west. On what bearing must the kayaker paddle to return directly to their starting point? (round to the nearest degree)"

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** 027°

**Explanation Provided:**
The kayaker needs to go in the opposite direction: northeast.
Angle from north = arctan(1.6/3.1) ≈ arctan(0.5161) ≈ 27.3°
Bearing ≈ 027°

**Assessment:**

* Return bearing calculation (opposite direction)
* Clear specifications: 3.1 km south, 1.6 km west displacement
* Inverse bearing calculation
* Follows immediately after Q20 (natural continuation)
* Tests understanding of opposite bearings

**Note:** This is the final question of Chapter 15, marking completion of the full trigonometry chapter.
