## Question 6

**Source:** Exercise 15D - Question 1c - Page 305

**Question Text:** "Godot analyzes a right triangle with an opposite side of 3 cm and an adjacent side of 2 cm. Find the angle θ (round to 1 decimal place)."

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** 56.3

**Explanation Provided:**
tan θ = 3/2 = 1.5
θ = arctan(1.5) ≈ 56.3°

**Assessment:**

* Excellent clarity! This question explicitly states:

  * Which side is opposite (3 cm)
  * Which side is adjacent (2 cm)
  * What to find (angle θ)
  * Relationship is unambiguous

**Pedagogical Strengths:**

* Clear problem specification
* Inverse tangent (arctan) function application
* Demonstrates that arctan is used for opposite/adjacent pairs
* Ratio greater than 1 (3/2) creates angle > 45°



**Mathematical Techniques:**

* Identifies correct ratio (tangent for opposite/adjacent)
* Uses inverse tangent function
* Decimal approximation
* Reinforces inverse trigonometric thinking

**Pattern Continuation:**
Explicit specification of opposite and adjacent sides = Correct answer
