## Question 3

**Source:** Exercise 15B - Question 2b - Page 301

**Question Text:** "Franziska examines a right triangle with a 76° angle, an adjacent side of 16 cm, and needs to find the hypotenuse x. Find x (round to 2 decimal places)."

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** 66.12

**Explanation Provided:**
cos 76° = 16/x
x = 16/cos 76° = 16/0.2419 ≈ 66.12 cm

**Assessment:**

* Excellent clarity! This question specifies:

  * The specific angle (76°)
  * The side relationship (adjacent side 16 cm)
  * What to find (hypotenuse x)
  * The relationship is unambiguous

**Pedagogical Strengths:**

* Clear problem specification
* Uses non-special angle (76°) to test general application
* Requires rearranging the cosine ratio (solving for hypotenuse)
* Explicitly identifies adjacent side

**Mathematical Techniques:**

* Identifies correct ratio (cosine for adjacent side)
* Rearranges formula to solve for unknown hypotenuse
* Requires division and decimal approximation
* Demonstrates inverse trigonometric thinking

**Pattern Continued:**
Clear specification of angle and which side is which = Correct answer
Ambiguous specifications = Wrong answer
