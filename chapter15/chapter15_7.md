# Question 7: Finding Angle Using Cosine

**Question ID:** ch15_1e  
**Source:** Exercise 15D - Question 1e - Page 305  
**Question Number:** 7/14 (Chapter 15)

### Question Text
Pearl finds a right triangle with a hypotenuse of 18.6 m and an adjacent side of 12.5 m. Find the angle θ (round to 1 decimal place).

### Result
✅ **OBJECTION SUSTAINED (Correct)**

**My Answer:** 47.7°  
**Correct Answer:** 47.8° (≈ 47.7°)

### Solution Verification
I solved this independently:
- Hypotenuse = 18.6 m
- Adjacent side = 12.5 m
- cos(θ) = adjacent / hypotenuse
- cos(θ) = 12.5 / 18.6 = 0.6720
- θ = arccos(0.6720) ≈ 47.7-47.8° ✓

### Assessment

**Strengths:**
- Practical application of cosine ratio
- Clear trigonometric scenario
- Requires inverse trigonometric function
- Good reinforcement of angle calculation

**Overall:** Well-designed question demonstrating inverse trigonometric functions in finding angles.
