## Question 13

**Source:** Exercise 15F - Question 8a - Page 313

**Question Text:** "Edgeworth tracks a kayaker who paddles from their starting point: 3.1 km south, 1.6 km west. How far is the kayaker from their starting point? (round to 1 decimal place)"

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** 3.5

**Explanation Provided:**
distance = √(3.1² + 1.6²) = √(9.61 + 2.56) = √12.17 ≈ 3.5 km

**Assessment:**

* Pythagorean theorem application
* Clear specifications: 3.1 km south, 1.6 km west
* Tests distance calculation from Cartesian coordinates
* Two perpendicular displacement vectors
* Real-world navigation scenario (kayaker tracking)
