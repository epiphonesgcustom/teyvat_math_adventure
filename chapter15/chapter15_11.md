## Question 11

**Source:** Exercise 15E - Question 6 - Page 307

**Question Text:** "Athena tracks a model helicopter taking off vertically at 5 m/s. After 10 seconds, the angle of elevation from Sam (who is 1.8 m tall) to the helicopter is 62°. How far is Sam's head from the helicopter at this time? (round to 1 decimal place)"

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** 54.6

**Explanation Provided:**
Height of helicopter = 5 m/s × 10 s = 50 m
Vertical distance from Sam's head = 50 - 1.8 = 48.2 m
sin 62° = 48.2/distance
distance = 48.2/sin 62° = 48.2/0.8829 ≈ 54.6 m

**Assessment:**

* Excellent complex, multi-step problem!
* Clear specifications throughout:

  * Helicopter speed and time given
  * Sam's height specified (1.8 m)
  * Angle of elevation given (62°)
  * What to find = hypotenuse distance
  * No ambiguity

**Pedagogical Strengths:**

* MOST COMPLEX problem in Chapter 15
* Requires multiple steps:

  1. Calculate height from kinematics (distance = speed × time)
  2. Adjust for observer height (50 - 1.8)
  3. Apply trigonometry to find hypotenuse

* Integrates physics (motion) with mathematics (trigonometry)
* Teaches systems thinking (combining multiple concepts)

**Mathematical Techniques:**

* Kinematics: height = 5 m/s × 10 s = 50 m
* Subtraction for reference point: 50 - 1.8 = 48.2 m
* Inverse sine: distance = 48.2/sin(62°)
* Handles large angle (62°) correctly
* Decimal approximation with precision

**Real-World Connection:**

* Drone/helicopter tracking is modern scenario
* Vertical takeoff motion creates changing angle
* Observer height matters in real applications
* Shows integrated problem-solving

**Complexity Level:**

* Highest in tested questions (Q12-15)
* Requires synthesis of multiple concepts
* Multi-step calculation
* Real-world context integration

**Educational Value:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ EXCELLENT

* Integration of multiple concepts
* Real-world scenario (drone tracking)
* Clear specifications enable learning
* Appropriate difficulty progression
* Demonstrates power of trigonometry
