## Question 2

**Source:** Exercise 15B - Question 2a - Page 301

**Question Text:** "Apollo finds a right triangle with a 30° angle, a hypotenuse of 15 cm, and needs to find the vertical side x. Find x (round to 2 decimal places)."

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** 7.50

**Explanation Provided:**
sin 30° = x/15
x = 15 × sin 30° = 15 × 0.5 = 7.50 cm

**Assessment:**

* Excellent clarity! This question specifies:

  * The specific angle (30°)
  * Which dimension is the hypotenuse (15 cm)
  * Which dimension to find (vertical side x)
  * The relationship is unambiguous

**Pedagogical Strengths:**

* Clear problem specification
* Uses special angle (30°) for which sin value is known (0.5)
* Direct application of sine ratio
* Makes vertical side explicit

**Comparison to Q3:**
Q3 had ambiguity (which side is opposite?), Q4 is completely clear (vertical side = opposite to 30° angle). The clarity difference is stark and accounts for the correct answer.

**Pattern Confirmed:**
Clear specifications → Correct answers
Ambiguous specifications → Wrong answers
