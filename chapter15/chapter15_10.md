## Question 10

**Source:** Exercise 15E - Question 3 - Page 307

**Question Text:** "Franziska observes a lighthouse from a boat. The angle of elevation from the boat to the top of the lighthouse (25 m above sea level) is 6°. Calculate the horizontal distance from the boat to the lighthouse (round to the nearest meter)."

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** 238

**Explanation Provided:**
tan 6° = 25/distance
distance = 25/tan 6° = 25/0.1051 ≈ 238 m

**Assessment:**

* Excellent real-world application!
* Crystal clear specifications:

  * Vertical height = 25 m
  * Angle of elevation = 6° (measured from horizontal)
  * What to find = horizontal distance
  * No ambiguity

**Pedagogical Strengths:**

* ANGLE OF ELEVATION concept introduced clearly
* Practical lighthouse scenario (classic trigonometry problem)
* Teaches inverse relationship: small angle = large distance
* Very small angle (6°) shows boat is far away
* Requires rearranging formula to solve for distance

**Mathematical Techniques:**

* Identifies correct ratio (tangent for opposite/adjacent)
* Rearranges formula: distance = 25/tan(6°)
* Handles small angle correctly
* Division by small number produces large result (238m)
* Demonstrates why small angles indicate distant objects

**Real-World Connection:**

* Navigation and surveying use angle of elevation
* Lighthouse sighting is practical maritime scenario
* Small angle (6°) is realistic for distant object
* Shows importance of accurate angle measurement

**Educational Value:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ EXCELLENT

* Introduces angle of elevation terminology
* Clear geometric setup
* Requires formula manipulation
* Maintains mathematical rigor
* Excellent real-world context
