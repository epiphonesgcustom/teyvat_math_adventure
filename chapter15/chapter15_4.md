## Question 4

**Source:** Exercise 15B - Question 2d - Page 301

**Question Text:** "Athena investigates a right triangle with a 42° angle and an opposite side of 5 cm. She needs to find the adjacent side x. Find x (round to 2 decimal places)."

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** 5.55

**Explanation Provided:**
tan 42° = 5/x
x = 5/tan 42° = 5/0.9004 ≈ 5.56 cm

**Assessment:**

* Excellent clarity! This question specifies:

  * The specific angle (42°)
  * The side relationship (opposite side 5 cm)
  * What to find (adjacent side x)
  * The relationship is unambiguous

**Pedagogical Strengths:**

* Clear problem specification
* Uses tangent ratio for opposite/adjacent relationship
* Requires rearranging the tangent formula
* Tests inverse trigonometric thinking (solving for unknown adjacent)
* Includes all three trig ratios across questions Q4-6

**Mathematical Techniques:**

* Identifies correct ratio (tangent for opposite/adjacent)
* Rearranges formula to solve for unknown adjacent
* Requires division and decimal approximation
* Demonstrates inverse operations

**Pattern Solidified:**
Clear specification of angle and which side is which = Correct answer
This is the 4th consecutive correct answer with clear specifications (Q4, Q5, Q6 all correct)
versus Q1, Q3 which were incorrect with ambiguous specifications
