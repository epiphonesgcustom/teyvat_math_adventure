# Question 12: Sampling Without Replacement

**Question ID:** ch16_2  
**Source:** Exercise 16D - Question 2 - Page 332  
**Question Number:** 12/18

### Question Text
Maya has 4 red and 3 blue marbles. She draws two marbles WITHOUT replacement. What is the probability both are blue? Express as a fraction in simplest form.

### Result
✅ **OBJECTION SUSTAINED (Correct)**

**My Answer:** 1/7  
**Correct Answer:** 1/7

### Solution Verification
I solved this independently using conditional probability:
- Total marbles = 4 + 3 = 7
- Blue marbles = 3
- P(1st blue) = 3/7
- After removing 1 blue: 6 marbles remain, 2 blue
- P(2nd blue | 1st blue) = 2/6 = 1/3
- P(both blue) = 3/7 × 1/3 = 3/21 = 1/7 ✓

### Assessment

**Strengths:**
- Introduces sampling without replacement
- Clear contrast with Q11 (with replacement)
- Demonstrates conditional probability
- Shows how probabilities change when items are removed

**Overall:** Excellent follow-up showing the critical difference between sampling with and without replacement.
