# Question 9: Mutually Exclusive Events (OR Rule)

**Question ID:** ch16_2  
**Source:** Exercise 16C - Question 2 - Page 328  
**Question Number:** 9/18

### Question Text
Pearl has a spinner with 3 red sections, 2 blue sections, and 1 green section. What is the probability of landing on red OR blue? Express as a fraction.

### Result
✅ **OBJECTION SUSTAINED (Correct)**

**My Answer:** 5/6  
**Correct Answer:** 5/6

### Solution Verification
I solved this independently:
- Total sections = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6
- Red sections = 3, so P(red) = 3/6
- Blue sections = 2, so P(blue) = 2/6
- For mutually exclusive events: P(A OR B) = P(A) + P(B)
- P(red OR blue) = 3/6 + 2/6 = 5/6 ✓

### Assessment

**Strengths:**
- Introduces the addition rule for mutually exclusive events
- Uses clear, concrete spinner scenario
- Good visual representation of outcomes
- Reinforces fraction addition

**Overall:** Excellent question for introducing the OR rule and mutually exclusive events.
