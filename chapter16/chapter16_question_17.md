# Question 17: Birthday Paradox

**Question ID:** ch16_2  
**Source:** Exercise 16F - Question 2 - Page 339  
**Question Number:** 17/18

### Question Text
In a courtroom with 23 people, what is the approximate probability that at least two people share the same birthday? Round to 3 decimal places.

### Result
✅ **OBJECTION SUSTAINED (Correct)**

**My Answer:** 0.507  
**Correct Answer:** 0.507 (or 50.7%)

### Solution Verification
I solved this using the complement rule (classic Birthday Paradox approach):
- P(at least 1 match) = 1 - P(no matches)
- P(no matches) = (365/365) × (364/365) × (363/365) × ... × (343/365)
- P(no matches) ≈ 0.493
- P(at least 1 match) = 1 - 0.493 = 0.507 ✓

### Assessment

**Strengths:**
- Famous Birthday Paradox problem
- Introduces complement rule for complex scenarios
- Counter-intuitive result (surprisingly high probability with just 23 people)
- Excellent real-world application

**Overall:** Perfect capstone problem showcasing the power and elegance of the complement rule in probability.
