# Question 16: Card Probability Without Replacement

**Question ID:** ch16_1  
**Source:** Exercise 16F - Question 1 - Page 339  
**Question Number:** 16/18

### Question Text
Tracy performs a card trick. She has you pick 2 cards from a standard 52-card deck without replacement. What is the probability both cards are aces? Express as a fraction in simplest form.

### Result
✅ **OBJECTION SUSTAINED (Correct)**

**My Answer:** 1/221  
**Correct Answer:** 1/221

### Solution Verification
I solved this independently:
- Total cards = 52, aces = 4
- P(1st ace) = 4/52 = 1/13
- After removing 1 ace: 51 cards, 3 aces remain
- P(2nd ace | 1st ace) = 3/51 = 1/17
- P(both aces) = 1/13 × 1/17 = 1/221 ≈ 0.0045 ✓

### Assessment

**Strengths:**
- Classic playing card probability problem
- Demonstrates conditional probability with realistic scenario
- Requires proper simplification (1/13 × 1/17)
- Thematic fit with card trick context

**Overall:** Excellent real-world application of sampling without replacement with standard deck.
