**Question ID:** ch16_2  
**Source:** Exercise 16E - Question 2 - Page 336  
**Question Number:** 15/18

### Question Text
Franziska rolls a fair six-sided die. What is the expected value of the roll?

### Result
✅ **OBJECTION SUSTAINED (Correct)**

**My Answer:** 3.5  
**Correct Answer:** 3.5

### Solution Verification
I solved this independently:
- E(X) = 1(1/6) + 2(1/6) + 3(1/6) + 4(1/6) + 5(1/6) + 6(1/6)
- E(X) = (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6) / 6
- E(X) = 21 / 6 = 3.5 ✓

### Assessment

**Strengths:**
- Classic expected value problem with uniform distribution
- Elegant mathematical result (exactly in the middle)
- Good reinforcement of symmetry in probability
- Natural follow-up to Q14

**Overall:** Perfect capstone question for the chapter, showing that expected value doesn't need to be a possible outcome.
