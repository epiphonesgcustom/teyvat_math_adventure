# Question 5: Set Theory / Venn Diagram Problem

**Question ID:** ch16_5  
**Source:** Exercise 16B - Question 1 - Page 325  
**Question Number:** 5/18

### Question Text
Franziska surveys 100 students. 60 study Math, 45 study Science, and 25 study both. How many students study neither Math nor Science?

### Result
✅ **OBJECTION SUSTAINED (Correct)**

**My Answer:** 20 students  
**Correct Answer:** 20 students

### Solution Verification
I solved this independently using the inclusion-exclusion principle:

**Venn Diagram Breakdown:**
- Math only = 60 - 25 = 35 students
- Science only = 45 - 25 = 20 students
- Both = 25 students
- Total studying at least one = 35 + 20 + 25 = 80 students
- **Neither = 100 - 80 = 20 students** ✓

### Assessment

**Strengths:**
- Excellent real-world application (student survey)
- Tests understanding of set theory and Venn diagrams
- Introduces the inclusion-exclusion principle
- Connects probability concepts to counting problems
- Clear, well-structured problem

**Overall:** Excellent comprehensive question that bridges counting, set theory, and probability. Perfect as a fifth question to deepen conceptual understanding.
