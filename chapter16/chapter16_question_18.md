# Question 18: Total Probability with Contamination Testing

**Question ID:** ch16_3  
**Source:** Exercise 16F - Question 3 - Page 339  
**Question Number:** 18/18 (FINAL)

### Question Text
Detective Gumshoe knows that 2% of evidence samples are contaminated. If a sample is contaminated, the test gives a positive result 95% of the time. If not contaminated, it gives a positive result 5% of the time (false positive). What is the probability a randomly tested sample gives a positive result? Round to 3 decimal places.

### Result
✅ **OBJECTION SUSTAINED (Correct)**

**My Answer:** 0.068  
**Correct Answer:** 0.068 (or 6.8%)

### Solution Verification
I solved this using the law of total probability:
- P(positive) = P(positive | contaminated) × P(contaminated) + P(positive | not contaminated) × P(not contaminated)
- P(positive) = 0.95 × 0.02 + 0.05 × 0.98
- P(positive) = 0.019 + 0.049
- P(positive) = 0.068 ✓

### Assessment

**Strengths:**
- Real forensic evidence testing scenario
- Shows importance of false positives in testing
- Practical application of total probability law
- Perfect capstone to the chapter

**Overall:** Excellent final question integrating multiple probability concepts in a forensic context.
