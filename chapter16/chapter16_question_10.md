# Question 10: Complement Rule with Multiple Trials

**Question ID:** ch16_3  
**Source:** Exercise 16C - Question 3 - Page 328  
**Question Number:** 10/18

### Question Text
Godot tosses a fair coin 3 times. What is the probability of getting at least one head? Express as a fraction.

### Result
✅ **OBJECTION SUSTAINED (Correct)**

**My Answer:** 7/8  
**Correct Answer:** 7/8

### Solution Verification
I solved this independently using the complement rule:
- P(at least one head) = 1 - P(no heads)
- P(no heads) = P(all tails)
- P(all tails) = 1/2 × 1/2 × 1/2 = 1/8
- P(at least 1 head) = 1 - 1/8 = 7/8 ✓

### Assessment

**Strengths:**
- Excellent application of the complement rule
- Involves multiple independent trials
- "At least one" phrasing encourages strategic thinking
- Demonstrates that complement rule is often easier than direct counting

**Overall:** Perfect capstone question for questions 6-10, integrating independent events, complement rule, and multiplication principle.
