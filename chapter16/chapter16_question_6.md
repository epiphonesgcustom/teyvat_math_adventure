# Question 6: Conditional Probability with Venn Diagram

**Question ID:** ch16_2  
**Source:** Exercise 16B - Question 2 - Page 325  
**Question Number:** 6/18

### Question Text
Detective Gumshoe examines evidence: Of 80 cases, 50 involved fingerprints, 40 involved DNA, and 20 involved both. If a case is selected at random, what is the probability it involved DNA but NOT fingerprints? Express as a fraction.

### Result
✅ **OBJECTION SUSTAINED (Correct)**

**My Answer:** 1/4  
**Correct Answer:** 1/4

### Solution Verification
I solved this independently:
- Total cases = 80
- Fingerprints = 50
- DNA = 40
- Both = 20
- DNA only = DNA - Both = 40 - 20 = 20 cases
- Probability = 20/80 = 1/4 ✓

### Assessment

**Strengths:**
- Excellent application to detective/forensics context
- Tests understanding of conditional probability
- Requires Venn diagram thinking
- Builds on previous set theory concepts

**Overall:** Well-constructed question that extends Venn diagram problems to conditional probability scenarios.
