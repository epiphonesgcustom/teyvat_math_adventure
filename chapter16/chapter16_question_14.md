**Question ID:** ch16_1  
**Source:** Exercise 16E - Question 1 - Page 336  
**Question Number:** 14/18

### Question Text
Apollo plays a game where he wins $10 with probability 0.3, wins $5 with probability 0.5, and loses $2 with probability 0.2. What is his expected value per game?

### Result
✅ **OBJECTION SUSTAINED (Correct)**

**My Answer:** 5.1  
**Correct Answer:** $5.10

### Solution Verification
I solved this independently using the expected value formula:
- E(X) = Σ(outcome × probability)
- E(X) = 10(0.3) + 5(0.5) + (-2)(0.2)
- E(X) = 3 + 2.5 - 0.4
- E(X) = 5.1 ✓

### Assessment

**Strengths:**
- Introduces expected value concept
- Practical financial application
- Mixes positive and negative outcomes
- Good foundation for probability theory

**Overall:** Excellent question introducing expected value in a clear, engaging context.
