**Question ID:** ch16_1b  
**Source:** Exercise 16A - Question 1b - Page 321  
**Question Number:** 2/18

### Question Text
Maya rolls a standard six-sided die. What is the probability of rolling a number greater than 4? Express as a fraction.

### Result
✅ **OBJECTION SUSTAINED (Correct)**

**My Answer:** 1/3  
**Correct Answer:** 1/3

### Solution Verification
I solved this independently:
- A standard six-sided die has outcomes: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
- Numbers greater than 4: {5, 6}
- Favorable outcomes = 2
- Total outcomes = 6
- Probability = 2/6 = 1/3 ✓

### Assessment

**Strengths:**
- Clear, straightforward probability question with conditional event
- Good follow-up to question 1, introducing inequality conditions
- Reinforces fraction simplification

**Overall:** Well-constructed question building on foundational probability concepts.
