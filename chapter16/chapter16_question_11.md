# Question 11: Sampling with Replacement

**Question ID:** ch16_1  
**Source:** Exercise 16D - Question 1 - Page 332  
**Question Number:** 11/18

### Question Text
Phoenix has a bag with 3 red and 2 blue marbles. He draws one marble, replaces it, then draws again. What is the probability both marbles are red? Express as a fraction.

### Result
✅ **OBJECTION SUSTAINED (Correct)**

**My Answer:** 9/25  
**Correct Answer:** 9/25

### Solution Verification
I solved this independently:
- Total marbles = 3 + 2 = 5
- P(red) = 3/5
- With replacement: P(1st red) = 3/5, P(2nd red) = 3/5
- For independent events: P(both) = P(1st) × P(2nd)
- P(both red) = 3/5 × 3/5 = 9/25 ✓

### Assessment

**Strengths:**
- Introduces sampling with replacement
- Shows that replacement maintains independence
- Good practical application
- Natural progression from previous questions

**Overall:** Excellent introduction to sampling methods and how replacement affects probability.
