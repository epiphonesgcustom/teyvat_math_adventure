# Question 7: Independent Events Probability

**Question ID:** ch16_1c  
**Source:** Exercise 16C - Question 1a - Page 328  
**Question Number:** 7/18

### Question Text
Tracy performs two magic tricks. The probability of succeeding at the first trick is 0.8, and the second is 0.9. Assuming independence, what is the probability she succeeds at BOTH tricks?

### Result
✅ **OBJECTION SUSTAINED (Correct)**

**My Answer:** 0.72  
**Correct Answer:** 0.72

### Solution Verification
I solved this independently:
- P(succeed trick 1) = 0.8
- P(succeed trick 2) = 0.9
- For independent events: P(A AND B) = P(A) × P(B)
- P(both) = 0.8 × 0.9 = 0.72 ✓

### Assessment

**Strengths:**
- Introduces independent events rule
- Uses decimal notation
- Fun, relatable scenario (magic tricks)
- Clear application of multiplication rule

**Overall:** Excellent question for teaching the multiplication rule for independent events.
