# Question 8: Compound Independent Events with Coin Flips

**Question ID:** ch16_1d  
**Source:** Exercise 16C - Question 1b - Page 328  
**Question Number:** 8/18

### Question Text
Klavier flips a fair coin twice. What is the probability of getting heads on the first flip AND tails on the second flip? Express as a fraction.

### Result
✅ **OBJECTION SUSTAINED (Correct)**

**My Answer:** 1/4  
**Correct Answer:** 1/4

### Solution Verification
I solved this independently:
- P(heads on 1st flip) = 1/2
- P(tails on 2nd flip) = 1/2
- For independent events: P(A AND B) = P(A) × P(B)
- P(heads then tails) = 1/2 × 1/2 = 1/4 ✓

### Assessment

**Strengths:**
- Classic coin flip probability problem
- Tests understanding of independent events with equal probabilities
- Good reinforcement with different sequence than previous question
- Clear, concise problem statement

**Overall:** Excellent follow-up to question 7, demonstrating the multiplication rule with a different scenario.
