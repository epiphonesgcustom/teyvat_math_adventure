# Question 4: Probability of Complementary Event

**Question ID:** ch16_3  
**Source:** Exercise 16A - Question 3 - Page 321  
**Question Number:** 4/18

### Question Text
Apollo knows that the probability of rain tomorrow is 0.35. What is the probability that it will NOT rain tomorrow?

### Result
✅ **OBJECTION SUSTAINED (Correct)**

**My Answer:** 0.65  
**Correct Answer:** 0.65

### Solution Verification
I solved this independently:
- P(rain) = 0.35
- Complementary event rule: P(event) + P(complement) = 1
- P(not rain) = 1 - P(rain)
- P(not rain) = 1 - 0.35 = 0.65 ✓

### Assessment

**Strengths:**
- Introduces the complementary event concept
- Uses decimal notation
- Connects probability to real-world scenario (weather)
- Tests understanding of probability rules

**Overall:** Excellent question for introducing the complementary event rule, a fundamental probability concept.
