# Question 13: Law of Total Probability

**Question ID:** ch16_3  
**Source:** Exercise 16D - Question 3 - Page 332  
**Question Number:** 13/18

### Question Text
Edgeworth analyzes witness reliability: If a witness is truthful (70% chance), they give correct testimony 90% of the time. If lying (30% chance), they give correct testimony only 20% of the time. What is the probability a random witness gives correct testimony?

### Result
✅ **OBJECTION SUSTAINED (Correct)**

**My Answer:** 0.69  
**Correct Answer:** 0.69

### Solution Verification
I solved this independently using the law of total probability:
- P(correct) = P(correct | truthful) × P(truthful) + P(correct | lying) × P(lying)
- P(correct) = 0.90 × 0.70 + 0.20 × 0.30
- P(correct) = 0.63 + 0.06 = 0.69 ✓

### Assessment

**Strengths:**
- Excellent real-world application (witness testimony)
- Introduces law of total probability
- Shows conditional probability in action
- Engaging Ace Attorney-themed scenario

**Overall:** Excellent sophisticated question demonstrating total probability law in a practical context.
