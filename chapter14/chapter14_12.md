## Question 12

**Source:** Exercise 14D - Question 1a - Page 288

**Question Text:** "Maya solves by factoring: x² + 6x + 8 = 0. Find the two values of x (enter the smaller value)."

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** -4

**Explanation Provided:**
- Step 1: Factor: x² + 6x + 8 = (x + 2)(x + 4)
- Step 2: Set each factor to 0
- Step 3: x + 2 = 0 → x = -2
- Step 4: x + 4 = 0 → x = -4
- The smaller value is -4.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Excellent application! Q12 applies quadratic factoring to solving equations, integrating Q9 skills with equation solving.
- Outstanding pedagogical value: teaches the Zero Product Property (if ab = 0, then a = 0 or b = 0), fundamental to solving by factoring.
- The explanation clearly shows: factor the quadratic, apply Zero Product Property, solve each linear equation, identify the smaller solution.
- Perfect progression: Q9-10 teach factoring, Q12 shows how factoring solves quadratic equations.
- Maya Fey's character involves the dramatic revelation that equations can be solved by factoring.
- The problem teaches a powerful technique: any factorable quadratic can be solved by factoring instead of using the quadratic formula.
- Clear notation showing both solutions and the comparison to find the smaller value.

**Pedagogical Strengths:**
- Zero Product Property
- Solving quadratic equations by factoring
- Integration of factoring with equation solving
- Two solutions from quadratic equation
- Comparison/ordering of solutions
- Practical application
- Foundation for more complex quadratics
