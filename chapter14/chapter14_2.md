## Question 2

**Source:** Exercise 14A - Question 1b - Page 277

**Question Text:** "Maya expands: -2(4x - 3). What is the simplified result?"

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** -8x + 6

**Explanation Provided:**
- Step 1: -2(4x - 3)
- Step 2: = -2 × 4x + (-2) × (-3)
- Step 3: = -8x + 6

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Excellent second question! Introduces negative coefficients and subtraction within parentheses.
- Outstanding pedagogical value: teaches that (-2) × (-3) = +6, a critical sign rule that many students struggle with.
- The explanation clearly shows the sign multiplication: negative times negative equals positive.
- Perfect progression from Q1: moves from positive to negative coefficient, maintaining the distributive property structure.
- Maya Fey's character involvement continues while presenting increasingly complex expansion.
- The problem teaches both distribution AND sign rules, two essential algebraic concepts.
- Clear notation showing the intermediate step with explicit signs helps prevent errors.

**Pedagogical Strengths:**
- Negative coefficient handling
- Sign rule for multiplication (neg × neg = pos)
- Clear step-by-step distribution
- Natural progression from Q1
- Addresses common student misconception (often get -8x - 6)
