## Question 6

**Source:** Exercise 14B - Question 1b - Page 281

**Question Text:** "Detective Gumshoe solves: 5 - 3x = 11. Find x."

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** -2

**Explanation Provided:**
- Step 1: 5 - 3x = 11
- Step 2: -3x = 11 - 5
- Step 3: -3x = 6
- Step 4: x = -2

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Excellent progression! Q6 introduces negative solutions to equations.
- Outstanding pedagogical value: shows that equations can have negative solutions; constant must be isolated before dividing by coefficient.
- The explanation clearly shows: subtract constant (5), get -3x = 6, divide by negative coefficient to get negative result.
- Perfect continuation from Q5: both are linear equations but Q6 has negative coefficient and negative solution.
- Dick Gumshoe's detective character suits the investigative problem-solving approach.
- The problem teaches sign handling in equations: dividing by negative coefficient produces negative solution.
- Clear notation showing the division by -3.

**Pedagogical Strengths:**
- Negative coefficients
- Negative solutions
- Division by negative numbers
- Proper equation isolation
- Sign rules application
- Natural progression from Q5
