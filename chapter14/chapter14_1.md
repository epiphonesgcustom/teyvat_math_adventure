## Question 1

**Source:** Exercise 14A - Question 1a - Page 277

**Question Text:** "Phoenix needs to expand the expression: 3(x + 5). What is the result?"

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** 3x + 15

**Explanation Provided:**
- Step 1: Distribute 3 to each term
- Step 2: 3(x + 5) = 3 × x + 3 × 5
- Step 3: = 3x + 15

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Excellent opening question! Introduces the distributive property with simple, clear example.
- Outstanding pedagogical value: uses concrete numbers (3 and 5) with a variable (x), making the distribution concept accessible.
- The explanation clearly shows each step of the distributive property application.
- Perfect difficulty for Q1: not too simple (requires understanding distribution), not too complex.
- Miles Edgeworth's character involvement continues while introducing algebra topics.
- The distributive property is foundational for all algebraic expansion, making this an ideal starting point.
- Clean notation and clear variable use.

**Pedagogical Note:** Chapter 14 "The Algebraic Accusation" signals shift from geometry to algebra - this is an appropriate transition question that builds on prior arithmetic knowledge.
