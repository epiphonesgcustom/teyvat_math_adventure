## Question 10

**Source:** Exercise 14C - Question 1b - Page 285

**Question Text:** "Godot factorizes: x² - 7x + 12. What is the factored form?"

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** (x - 3)(x - 4)

**Explanation Provided:**
- Step 1: Find factors of 12 that add to -7
- Step 2: (-3) × (-4) = 12 and (-3) + (-4) = -7 ✓
- Step 3: x² - 7x + 12 = (x - 3)(x - 4)

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Excellent extension of Q9! Q10 introduces negative coefficients in quadratic factoring.
- Outstanding pedagogical value: shows that negative middle coefficient requires two negative factors, teaching sign logic.
- The explanation clearly shows: negative factors multiply to positive (constant), add to negative (middle coefficient).
- Perfect continuation: Q9 had all positive, Q10 adds the case with negative factors, teaching sign logic.
- Godot's analytical character suits the systematic approach to finding negative factor pairs.
- The problem teaches critical sign reasoning: negative sum with positive product requires both factors negative.
- Clear notation showing both the product and sum verification.

**Pedagogical Strengths:**
- Negative factor pairs
- Sign reasoning in factoring
- Product and sum conditions with negatives
- Reinforcement of quadratic factoring method
- Sign logic teaching
- Natural progression from Q9
