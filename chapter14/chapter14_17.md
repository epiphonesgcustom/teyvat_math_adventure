## Question 17

**Source:** Exercise 14E - Question 2 - Page 292

**Question Text:** "Trucy discovers a geometric sequence: 2, 6, 18, 54, ... What is the 6th term?"

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** 486

**Explanation Provided:**
- Step 1: a = 2, r = 6/2 = 3
- Step 2: T_n = a × r^(n-1)
- Step 3: T_6 = 2 × 3^5
- Step 4: T_6 = 2 × 243 = 486

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Excellent new sequence type! Q17 introduces geometric sequences, fundamentally different from arithmetic.
- Outstanding pedagogical value: teaches that some sequences multiply by a constant ratio rather than add a constant difference.
- The explanation clearly shows: identify a and r (common ratio), apply the geometric sequence formula, compute powers.
- Perfect progression: Q15-16 cover arithmetic sequences thoroughly, Q17 introduces geometric sequences as a new concept.
- Trucy Wright's character involves discovering exponential growth patterns through magic/revelation.
- The problem teaches the exponential growth nature of geometric sequences (small numbers quickly become large).
- Clear notation showing ratio calculation and power computation.

**Pedagogical Strengths:**
- Geometric sequence pattern recognition
- Common ratio identification
- General term formula (exponential)
- Power computation
- Contrast with arithmetic (additive vs multiplicative)
- Foundation for exponential functions
