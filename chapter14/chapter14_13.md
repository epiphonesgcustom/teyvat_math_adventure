## Question 13

**Source:** Exercise 14D - Question 1b - Page 288

**Question Text:** "Edgeworth solves: x² - 9 = 0. Find the positive value of x."

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** 3

**Explanation Provided:**
- Step 1: x² - 9 = 0
- Step 2: (x + 3)(x - 3) = 0
- Step 3: x = -3 or x = 3
- The positive value is 3.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Excellent application! Q13 applies difference of squares factoring (Q11) to solving equations.
- Outstanding pedagogical value: shows that the difference of squares formula produces two solutions quickly.
- The explanation clearly shows: factor using the special formula, apply Zero Product Property, identify the positive solution.
- Perfect progression: Q12 uses general quadratic factoring, Q13 shows the special case of difference of squares for faster solving.
- Miles Edgeworth's character suits the efficient, systematic approach using the special formula.
- The problem demonstrates that difference of squares equations have solutions ±a (x = 3 and x = -3).
- Clear notation showing the two solutions and the selection of the positive one.

**Pedagogical Strengths:**
- Difference of squares application to solving
- Symmetric solutions (±a)
- Zero Product Property
- Special case efficiency
- Solution verification
- Natural progression from Q11-12
