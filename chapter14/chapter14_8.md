## Question 8

**Source:** Exercise 14B - Question 3 - Page 281

**Question Text:** "Klavier solves an equation with variables on both sides: 3x + 5 = x + 13. Find x."

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** 4

**Explanation Provided:**
- Step 1: 3x + 5 = x + 13
- Step 2: 3x - x = 13 - 5
- Step 3: 2x = 8
- Step 4: x = 4

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Excellent progression! Q8 introduces equations with variables on both sides, a significant step in complexity.
- Outstanding pedagogical value: teaches how to consolidate variables on one side and constants on the other.
- The explanation clearly shows: move variables left (3x - x), move constants right (13 - 5), then solve.
- Perfect continuation: Q5-7 prepare students for this, Q8 presents the more complex case where variables appear on both sides.
- Klavier Gavin's character suits the logical, methodical approach to balancing equations.
- The problem teaches essential technique: systematically collecting like terms on appropriate sides.
- Clear notation showing the rearrangement of terms.

**Pedagogical Strengths:**
- Variables on both sides
- Collecting like terms
- Systematic rearrangement
- Multi-step solving with both variable and constant movement
- Foundation for more complex equations
- Clear progression of difficulty
