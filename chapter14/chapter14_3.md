## Question 3

**Source:** Exercise 14A - Question 2a - Page 277

**Question Text:** "Edgeworth needs to factorize: 6x + 9. What is the factored form?"

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** 3(2x + 3)

**Explanation Provided:**
- Step 1: GCF of 6 and 9 is 3
- Step 2: 6x + 9 = 3 × 2x + 3 × 3
- Step 3: = 3(2x + 3)

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Excellent third question! Introduces factoring as the reverse of expansion (inverse operation).
- Outstanding pedagogical value: shows that factoring requires finding the GCF (Greatest Common Factor) and applying the distributive property in reverse.
- The explanation clearly shows the GCF identification and the reverse distribution process.
- Perfect progression: Q1-2 expand, Q3 factors, teaching the relationship between these inverse operations.
- Miles Edgeworth's character suits the analytical work of finding common factors.
- The problem teaches an essential algebraic skill: finding common factors is foundational for more complex factoring.
- Clear notation showing how 3 is factored out of both terms.

**Pedagogical Strengths:**
- GCF identification
- Reverse distributive property
- Clear inverse relationship to expansion
- Appropriate difficulty progression
- Foundation for quadratic factoring (later)
