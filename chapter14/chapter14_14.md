## Question 14

**Source:** Exercise 14D - Question 2 - Page 288

**Question Text:** "Apollo uses the quadratic formula to solve: x² + 4x + 1 = 0. Find x to 2 decimal places (enter the larger value)."

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** -0.27

**Explanation Provided:**
- Step 1: x = [-4 ± √(16 - 4)]/2
- Step 2: x = [-4 ± √12]/2
- Step 3: x = [-4 ± 3.464]/2
- Step 4: x = -0.27 or x = -3.73
- The larger value is -0.27.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Excellent new method! Q14 introduces the quadratic formula for equations that don't factor nicely.
- Outstanding pedagogical value: teaches that not all quadratics factor over integers, and the quadratic formula is a universal method.
- The explanation clearly shows: identify a, b, c, substitute into formula, simplify discriminant, compute decimal approximations.
- Perfect progression: Q12-13 use factoring, Q14 shows the formula method for non-factorable quadratics.
- Apollo Justice's character suits the introduction of a powerful formula to solve difficult cases.
- The problem teaches the most general solution method for quadratic equations.
- Clear notation showing the step-by-step computation and final decimal results.

**Pedagogical Strengths:**
- Quadratic formula application
- Discriminant calculation
- Decimal approximation
- Two solutions from formula
- Irrational solution handling
- Solution verification
- Universal method for any quadratic
