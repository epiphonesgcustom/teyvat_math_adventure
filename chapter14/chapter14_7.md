## Question 7

**Source:** Exercise 14B - Question 2 - Page 281

**Question Text:** "Trucy solves: (x + 3)/2 = 5. Find x."

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** 7

**Explanation Provided:**
- Step 1: (x + 3)/2 = 5
- Step 2: Multiply both sides by 2: x + 3 = 10
- Step 3: x = 10 - 3
- Step 4: x = 7

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Excellent progression! Q7 introduces equations with fractions and the multiplication principle.
- Outstanding pedagogical value: shows that equations with fractions can be solved by multiplying to clear denominators, a key technique for rational equations.
- The explanation clearly shows: multiply by denominator (2), then solve the resulting simple equation.
- Perfect continuation: Q5-6 solve simple linear equations, Q7 adds complexity with fractions.
- Trucy Wright's character involves a magic-like revelation of the multiplication principle to clear fractions.
- The problem teaches an essential technique: clearing fractions by multiplying by common denominators.
- Clear notation showing the multiplication step and resulting simplified equation.

**Pedagogical Strengths:**
- Clearing fractions (multiplying by denominator)
- Equations with fractions
- Multi-step equation solving
- Understanding of reciprocal/multiplication principle
- Clear step progression
- Foundation for more complex rational equations
