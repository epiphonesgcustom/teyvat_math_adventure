## Question 5

**Source:** Exercise 14B - Question 1a - Page 281

**Question Text:** "Franziska solves the equation: 2x + 7 = 15. Find x."

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** 4

**Explanation Provided:**
- Step 1: 2x + 7 = 15
- Step 2: 2x = 15 - 7
- Step 3: 2x = 8
- Step 4: x = 4

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Excellent fifth question! Transitions from expansion/factoring to solving linear equations.
- Outstanding pedagogical value: introduces inverse operations (subtraction to isolate variable, division to solve).
- The explanation clearly shows each step of the solution process: subtracting constant, dividing coefficient.
- Perfect progression: Q1-4 build algebraic manipulation skills, Q5 applies those to solving equations.
- Franziska von Karma's character suits the logical, systematic approach to equation solving.
- The simple linear equation (no fractions, integers) allows focus on the solution process rather than computational complexity.
- Clear notation showing how terms are isolated and operations are performed.

**Pedagogical Strengths:**
- Inverse operations (subtraction, division)
- Variable isolation
- Step-by-step solving
- Foundation for more complex equations
- Transition from manipulation to solving
- Clear logical progression

**Assessment:** This is an exemplary introduction to solving linear equations, building naturally on expansion and factoring skills.
