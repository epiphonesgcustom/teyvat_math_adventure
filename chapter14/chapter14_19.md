## Question 19

**Source:** Exercise 14F - Question 1 - Page 296

**Question Text:** "Pearl has twice as many spirit channeling beads as Maya. Together they have 27 beads. How many beads does Pearl have?"

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** 18

**Explanation Provided:**
- Step 1: Let Maya have x beads
- Step 2: Pearl has 2x beads
- Step 3: x + 2x = 27
- Step 4: 3x = 27, so x = 9
- Step 5: Pearl has 2 × 9 = 18 beads

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Excellent application! Q19 transitions to word problems, applying algebraic skills to real-world scenarios.
- Outstanding pedagogical value: teaches how to translate verbal relationships into equations and solve.
- The explanation clearly shows: define variables, express relationships, write equation, solve, find the answer to the original question.
- Perfect progression: sequences were abstract, word problems show practical applications of algebra.
- Pearl Fey's character and spirit channeling beads fit naturally into the narrative.
- The problem teaches the essential skill of translating language to mathematics.
- Clear notation showing variable definition and relationship expression.

**Pedagogical Strengths:**
- Variable definition from word problem
- Relationship translation (twice as many)
- Equation setup from context
- Linear equation solving
- Answer extraction from solution
- Real-world application
- Bridge to applied mathematics
