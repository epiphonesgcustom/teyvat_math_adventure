## Question 9

**Source:** Exercise 14C - Question 1a - Page 285

**Question Text:** "Pearl factorizes: x² + 5x + 6. What is the factored form?"

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** (x + 2)(x + 3)

**Explanation Provided:**
- Step 1: Find factors of 6 that add to 5
- Step 2: 2 × 3 = 6 and 2 + 3 = 5 ✓
- Step 3: x² + 5x + 6 = (x + 2)(x + 3)

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Excellent transition! Q9 introduces quadratic factoring, a major step in algebraic complexity.
- Outstanding pedagogical value: teaches the key technique of finding factor pairs that satisfy sum/product conditions.
- The explanation clearly shows the systematic approach: find the factor pair, verify both conditions, write as binomials.
- Perfect progression: Q1-8 build foundation in expansion, simple factoring, and equation solving, Q9 applies these to quadratics.
- Pearl Fey's character involves discovering the hidden pattern of factor pairs that work.
- The problem teaches the most important quadratic factoring method: AC method (product = 6, sum = 5).
- Clear notation showing the verification and final binomial form.

**Pedagogical Strengths:**
- Factor pair identification
- Sum and product conditions
- Quadratic trinomial factoring
- Binomial expansion verification
- Foundation for solving quadratic equations
- Critical algebraic skill
- Clear step-by-step approach

**Assessment:** This is an excellent introduction to quadratic factoring with appropriate scaffolding.
