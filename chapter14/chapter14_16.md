## Question 16

**Source:** Exercise 14E - Question 1b - Page 292

**Question Text:** "Detective Gumshoe finds the sequence: 50, 45, 40, 35, ... What is the 20th term?"

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** -45

**Explanation Provided:**
- Step 1: a = 50, d = -5
- Step 2: T_20 = 50 + (20 - 1) × (-5)
- Step 3: T_20 = 50 + 19 × (-5)
- Step 4: T_20 = 50 - 95 = -45

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Excellent continuation! Q16 extends arithmetic sequences to negative common differences and negative terms.
- Outstanding pedagogical value: demonstrates that arithmetic sequences can have negative differences and produce negative terms.
- The explanation clearly shows: identify a and d (negative), apply formula, compute with negative arithmetic.
- Perfect progression: Q15 had positive difference, Q16 shows negative difference, teaching the generality of the formula.
- Dick Gumshoe's character involves detective work discovering negative terms in sequences.
- The problem reinforces that the formula T_n = a + (n-1)d works universally regardless of sign.
- Clear notation showing negative difference handling and resulting negative term.

**Pedagogical Strengths:**
- Negative common difference
- Negative terms in sequences
- Formula application with negatives
- Natural progression from Q15
- Generalization of formula
