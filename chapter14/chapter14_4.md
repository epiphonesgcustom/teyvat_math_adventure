## Question 4

**Source:** Exercise 14A - Question 2b - Page 277

**Question Text:** "Apollo factorizes: 5x² - 10x. What is the factored form?"

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** 5x(x - 2)

**Explanation Provided:**
- Step 1: GCF of 5x² and 10x is 5x
- Step 2: 5x² - 10x = 5x × x - 5x × 2
- Step 3: = 5x(x - 2)

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Excellent fourth question! Extends factoring to include variable factors (GCF includes both coefficients and variables).
- Outstanding pedagogical value: teaches that GCF can include variables; students must find GCF of both numbers and variables.
- The explanation clearly shows that GCF = 5x (not just 5), combining coefficient and variable factors.
- Perfect progression: Q3 factors only constants, Q4 adds variable factors, naturally building complexity.
- Apollo Justice's character involvement continues while presenting more sophisticated factoring.
- The problem teaches essential algebra: recognizing common variable factors is crucial for factoring polynomials.
- Clear notation showing how 5x is factored from both terms.

**Pedagogical Strengths:**
- GCF with variables
- Coefficient and variable factor identification
- Reverse distribution with variables
- Foundation for polynomial factoring
- Clear step-by-step guidance
