## Question 15

**Source:** Exercise 14E - Question 1a - Page 292

**Question Text:** "Franziska examines the sequence: 3, 7, 11, 15, ... What is the 10th term?"

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** 39

**Explanation Provided:**
- Step 1: First term a = 3, difference d = 4
- Step 2: T_n = a + (n - 1)d
- Step 3: T_10 = 3 + (10 - 1) × 4
- Step 4: T_10 = 3 + 36 = 39

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Excellent transition! Q15 introduces arithmetic sequences, a new topic within algebra.
- Outstanding pedagogical value: teaches the pattern recognition and formula for arithmetic sequences.
- The explanation clearly shows: identify first term and common difference, apply the general term formula, compute the requested term.
- Perfect progression: after mastering quadratic equations, introduces sequences as an extension of algebraic thinking.
- Franziska von Karma's character suits the systematic examination of patterns.
- The problem teaches the general term formula, a fundamental tool for sequence work.
- Clear notation showing the formula application with proper substitution.

**Pedagogical Strengths:**
- Arithmetic sequence pattern recognition
- Common difference identification
- General term formula
- Formula application
- Pattern-based thinking
- Foundation for series and more complex sequences
