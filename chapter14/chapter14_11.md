## Question 11

**Source:** Exercise 14C - Question 2 - Page 285

**Question Text:** "Phoenix factorizes a difference of squares: x² - 25. What is the factored form?"

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** (x + 5)(x - 5)

**Explanation Provided:**
- Step 1: Recognize difference of squares pattern
- Step 2: x² - 25 = x² - 5²
- Step 3: = (x + 5)(x - 5)

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Excellent special case! Q11 introduces difference of squares, a critical algebraic identity.
- Outstanding pedagogical value: teaches recognition of the a² - b² = (a + b)(a - b) pattern, one of the most important identities in algebra.
- The explanation clearly shows: identify the pattern, express as difference of squares, apply the formula.
- Perfect progression: Q9-10 teach general quadratic factoring, Q11 shows a special case with its own formula.
- Miles Edgeworth's analytical character suits the pattern recognition required.
- The problem teaches a shortcut that's faster than the trinomial method and works for any difference of squares.
- Clear notation showing the recognition of 25 = 5².

**Pedagogical Strengths:**
- Difference of squares pattern recognition
- Perfect square identification
- Special algebraic identity
- Faster factoring method
- Foundation for more complex expressions
- Critical algebraic technique
