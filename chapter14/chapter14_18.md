## Question 18

**Source:** Exercise 14E - Question 3 - Page 292

**Question Text:** "Klavier analyzes the pattern: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, ... What is the 12th term?"

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** 144

**Explanation Provided:**
- Step 1: Pattern: 1² = 1, 2² = 4, 3² = 9, ...
- Step 2: The nth term = n²
- Step 3: 12th term = 12²
- Step 4: = 144

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Excellent pattern recognition problem! Q18 introduces quadratic sequences (perfect squares).
- Outstanding pedagogical value: teaches that some sequences follow nonlinear patterns like n², different from arithmetic and geometric.
- The explanation clearly shows: recognize the perfect square pattern, identify the formula, apply it.
- Perfect progression: Q15-17 cover linear and exponential sequences, Q18 shows quadratic sequences.
- Klavier Gavin's analytical character suits pattern recognition and formula discovery.
- The problem teaches that sequences can have various underlying patterns, not just arithmetic or geometric.
- Clear notation showing the perfect square pattern and formula derivation.

**Pedagogical Strengths:**
- Pattern recognition (non-standard)
- Perfect square identification
- Quadratic formula for sequences
- Formula application
- Diversity of sequence types
- Foundation for polynomial sequences
