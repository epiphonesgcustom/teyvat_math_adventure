## Question 20

**Source:** Exercise 14F - Question 2 - Page 296

**Question Text:** "Godot finds three consecutive case numbers that sum to 48. What is the middle case number?"

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** 16

**Explanation Provided:**
- Step 1: Let numbers be n, n+1, n+2
- Step 2: n + (n+1) + (n+2) = 48
- Step 3: 3n + 3 = 48
- Step 4: 3n = 45, so n = 15
- Step 5: Middle number = 15 + 1 = 16

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Excellent problem! Q20 applies algebra to consecutive numbers, a classic word problem type.
- Outstanding pedagogical value: teaches how to express consecutive numbers algebraically and solve.
- The explanation clearly shows: define consecutive numbers, set up equation, solve for first number, find the middle.
- Perfect continuation: more complex word problem building on Q19's foundation.
- Godot's character involves finding patterns through careful analysis.
- The problem teaches the standard approach to consecutive number problems.
- Clear notation showing the relationship between the three numbers and the final calculation.

**Pedagogical Strengths:**
- Consecutive number representation
- Equation setup with expressions
- Linear equation solving with expanded terms
- Multi-step problem solving
- Answer extraction from solution
- Real-world context (case numbers)
