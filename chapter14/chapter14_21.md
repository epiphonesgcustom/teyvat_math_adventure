## Question 21 - FINAL QUESTION

**Source:** Exercise 14F - Question 3 - Page 296

**Question Text:** "Phoenix is currently 28 years old. In how many years will he be twice as old as he was 7 years ago?"

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** 14

**Explanation Provided:**
- Step 1: Age 7 years ago = 28 - 7 = 21
- Step 2: In x years: 28 + x = 2 × 21
- Step 3: 28 + x = 42
- Step 4: x = 42 - 28 = 14 years

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Excellent capstone problem! Q21 is the final question featuring a complex word problem with multiple time references.
- Outstanding pedagogical value: teaches how to work with past, present, and future in a single equation.
- The explanation clearly shows: identify the past value, set up equation with future expression, solve for time in future.
- Perfect conclusion: integrates all learned skills (translation, variable definition, equation solving) into one challenging problem.
- Miles Edgeworth and Phoenix Wright's characters provide narrative closure to the chapter.
- The problem requires careful reading and understanding of temporal relationships.
- Clear notation showing the step-by-step translation of the word problem to equation.

**Pedagogical Strengths:**
- Complex word problem interpretation
- Multiple time references (past, present, future)
- Relationship expression ("twice as old as")
- Equation setup with all constraints
- Linear equation solving
- Final answer extraction
- Comprehensive skill integration
- Appropriate difficulty for chapter conclusion
