## Question 8

**Source:** Exercise 13C - Question 1c - Page 263

**Question Text:** "Klavier presents a large isosceles triangle AEB with base angles ∠A = 70° and ∠E = 70°. Inside it, a smaller triangle BDC is also isosceles with base angles ∠D = 70° and ∠C = 70°. Are triangles AEB and BDC similar? Answer "yes" or "no"."

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** yes

**Explanation Provided:**

* Triangle AEB (outer): ∠A = 70°, ∠E = 70°, ∠AEB = 180° - 70° - 70° = 40°
* Triangle BDC (inner): ∠D = 70°, ∠C = 70°, ∠DBC = 180° - 70° - 70° = 40°
* Both triangles have the same three angles: 70°, 70°, and 40°
* Therefore they are similar by AA (Angle-Angle) similarity!

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

* Excellent problem! Tests similarity with isosceles triangles and angle sum property.
* Outstanding pedagogical value: requires students to calculate the third angle and recognize that identical angle sets imply similarity.
* The explanation clearly shows both angle calculations and identifies all three angles for each triangle.
* Perfect scaffold: progresses from Q9 (given angles) to Q10 (computed angles plus isosceles constraint).
* Klavier Gavin's character involvement continues narrative engagement while presenting nested geometric figures.
* The problem elegantly demonstrates that different-sized triangles with identical angle measures are similar.
* This reinforces the fundamental principle that similarity depends on angles, not size.

**Pedagogical Strengths:**

* Clean isosceles triangle properties
* Clear angle sum calculation
* Direct application of AA similarity
* Visual concept of nested similar triangles
* Excellent progression in difficulty
