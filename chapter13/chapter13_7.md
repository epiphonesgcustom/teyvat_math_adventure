## Question 7

**Source:** Exercise 13C - Question 1b - Page 263

**Question Text:** "Trucy shows two triangles ABC and CDE that intersect at point C. Angle ABC = 40° and angle CDE = 40°. Angles ACB and DCE are vertically opposite. Are the triangles similar? Answer "yes" or "no"."

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** yes

**Explanation Provided:**

* We have:

  * ∠ABC = ∠CDE = 40°
  * ∠ACB = ∠DCE (vertically opposite angles are equal)

* Two pairs of equal angles means AA similarity!

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

* Excellent problem! Combines similarity with vertically opposite angles (a key geometric property).
* Outstanding pedagogical value: teaches that vertically opposite angles are equal and how this creates similar triangles.
* The explanation clearly identifies the two pairs of equal angles and applies AA similarity.
* Perfect difficulty progression: follows from Q8 (parallel lines creating similar triangles) with a different geometric mechanism (vertically opposite angles).
* Trucy Wright's character involvement continues narrative engagement while presenting a sophisticated geometric configuration.
* The problem elegantly shows how multiple geometric properties (equality of angles at a point, similarity criteria) work together.
* This naturally transitions students' thinking from congruence to similarity using angle properties.

**Pedagogical Strengths:**

* Clean two-pair angle equality
* Uses a fundamental angle property (vertically opposite)
* Simple, clear answer format
