## Question 6

**Source:** Exercise 13A - Question 2b - Page 257

**Question Text:** "Franziska presents four right triangles: A (sides 6cm, 8cm), B (sides 6cm, 8cm, 11cm), C (sides 6cm, 8cm, right angle), and D (sides 8cm, 6cm, right angle). Which triangles are congruent? Answer with the letter pair."

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** C and D

**Explanation Provided:**
- Triangle A: Only two sides given, not enough info
- Triangle B: Has a third side that doesn't match Pythagorean theorem
- Triangle C: Right triangle with legs 6cm, 8cm
- Triangle D: Right triangle with legs 8cm, 6cm (same as C!)
- C and D are congruent right triangles!

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Excellent problem! Tests ability to identify complete vs incomplete triangle specifications and recognize invalid triangles.
- Outstanding pedagogical value: includes distractors (A has incomplete info, B violates Pythagorean theorem), teaching careful analysis.
- The explanation clearly eliminates invalid options: A is incomplete, B is geometrically impossible.
- The explicit mention that B "doesn't match Pythagorean theorem" teaches the constraint that right triangle sides must satisfy a² + b² = c².
- Franziska von Karma's character involvement continues while presenting a challenging discrimination problem.
- The problem reinforces that triangles must be fully specified AND must be geometrically valid.
- This tests both congruence knowledge and geometric validity understanding.

**Pedagogical Note:** The inclusion of triangle B (with impossible measurements) is excellent for teaching that not all number combinations form valid triangles. This is an important constraint students sometimes miss.
