## Question 5

**Source:** Exercise 13A - Question 2a - Page 257

**Question Text:** "Detective Gumshoe has four triangles: A (sides 5m, 5m, angle α between them), B (sides 5m, 7m, angle α between them), C (sides 7m, 5m, angle α between them), and D (sides 7m, 7m, angle α between them). Which pair is congruent? Enter the letter pair (e.g., "AB" or "A and B")."

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** B and C

**Explanation Provided:**
- Triangle A: 5m, 5m with angle α
- Triangle B: 5m, 7m with angle α
- Triangle C: 7m, 5m with angle α (same as B!)
- Triangle D: 7m, 7m with angle α
- Triangles B and C are congruent by SAS - the order of the sides doesn't matter!

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Excellent comparison problem! Requires identifying which triangles share SAS congruence among multiple options.
- Outstanding pedagogical value: explicitly teaches that side order doesn't matter in SAS - (5, 7, α) and (7, 5, α) have the same two sides with angle α between them.
- The explanation clearly lists all four triangles and identifies which pair shares the same SAS configuration.
- The final note "the order of the sides doesn't matter" is critical and often misunderstood by students.
- Dick Gumshoe's character involvement as a detective continues narrative engagement while presenting a classification problem.
- The problem requires careful comparison - students must recognize that two triangles with the same measurements in different written order are still congruent.
- This naturally teaches precision in geometric reasoning while avoiding false strictness about notation order.

**Pedagogical Note:** The explicit statement "the order of the sides doesn't matter" is excellent for preventing confusion. Students often worry about whether (5, 7) and (7, 5) are different, and this clearly teaches they're not in the context of SAS congruence.
