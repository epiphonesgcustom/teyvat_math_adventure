## Question 13

**Source:** Exercise 13D - Question 3a - Page 269

**Question Text:** "Apollo found that triangle BCD has area 6.4 cm². Triangle ACE is similar to BCD with all sides 2.5 times larger. Find the area of triangle ACE (in cm²)."

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** 40

**Explanation Provided:**

* Step 1: Scale factor k = 2.5
* Step 2: Area scales by k²
* Step 3: Area of ACE = 2.5² × 6.4 cm²
* Step 4: Area of ACE = 6.25 × 6.4 = 40 cm²

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

* Excellent problem! Shifts from volume scaling to area scaling with similar figures.
* Outstanding pedagogical value: teaches that area scales by the SQUARE of the linear scale factor (k²), contrasting with the cube relationship for volumes (k³).
* The explanation clearly shows the k² scaling principle and applies it directly.
* Perfect scaffold: follows 3D volume scaling (Q11-14) with 2D area scaling, reinforcing the k², k³ patterns.
* Apollo Justice's character involvement continues while presenting the area scaling concept.
* The scale factor k = 2.5 is explicitly given, allowing focus on the area scaling concept rather than finding k.
* The calculation 2.5² = 6.25 followed by 6.25 × 6.4 = 40 is clean and demonstrates the two-step process clearly.

**Pedagogical Strengths:**

* Clear area scaling formula (k²)
* Direct contrast with volume scaling (k³)
* Simple decimal calculations
* Clean final answer (40)
* Excellent conceptual scaffolding
* Natural connection to previous 3D problems
