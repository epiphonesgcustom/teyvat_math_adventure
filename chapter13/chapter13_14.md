## Question 14 (FINAL)

**Source:** Exercise 13D - Question 5 - Page 269

**Question Text:** "Detective Gumshoe has a rhombus with sides 13.5 cm and area 162 cm². A similar rhombus has area 50 cm². Find the perimeter of the smaller rhombus (in cm, to 1 decimal place)."

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** 30

**Explanation Provided:**

* Step 1: Area ratio: k² = 50/162 = 25/81
* Step 2: k = √(25/81) = 5/9 ≈ 0.556
* Step 3: Side of smaller rhombus = (5/9) × 13.5 = 67.5/9 = 7.5 cm
* Step 4: Perimeter = 4 × 7.5 = 30 cm

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

* Excellent capstone problem! The final question integrates all similarity concepts into a sophisticated multi-step problem.
* Outstanding pedagogical value: requires finding linear scale factor from area ratio (reverse calculation), then finding perimeter from side length.
* The explanation shows all four essential steps: area ratio → k → linear scale → perimeter formula.
* Perfect closing problem: tests comprehensive understanding of:

  * Area scaling (k²)
  * Square root/radical operations
  * Fraction multiplication
  * Rhombus properties (4 equal sides)
  * Perimeter calculation

* Dick Gumshoe's character involvement continues while presenting the investigative, multi-step final problem.
* The unusual shape (rhombus) demonstrates that similarity principles apply to all polygons, not just triangles.
* Clean arithmetic: 5/9 × 13.5 = 7.5 allows direct integer perimeter result (30 cm).

**Pedagogical Strengths:**

* Comprehensive integration of concepts
* Inverse problem (area → side length)
* Appropriate difficulty for final question
* Clear, logical step-by-step progression
* Demonstrates similarity generality
* Clean numerical results
* Excellent narrative closure

**Assessment:** This is an exemplary final question that tests synthesis of all chapter concepts.
