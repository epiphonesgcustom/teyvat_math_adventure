## Question 12

**Source:** Exercise 13D - Question 2d - Page 269

**Question Text:** "Edgeworth examines two similar rectangular prisms. Prism A has volume 24 cm³ and height 5 cm. Prism B has volume 81 cm³ and height x cm. Find x."

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** 7.5

**Explanation Provided:**

* Step 1: Volume ratio = 81/24 = 27/8
* Step 2: k³ = 27/8
* Step 3: k = ∛(27/8) = 3/2 = 1.5
* Step 4: x = 1.5 × 5 = 7.5 cm

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

* Excellent inverse problem! Requires finding the linear scale factor from volume ratio.
* Outstanding pedagogical value: teaches cube root calculation (∛(27/8) = 3/2), converting from volume scaling back to linear scaling.
* The explanation clearly shows the three-step process: volume ratio → k³ → k (cube root)
* The simplification ∛(27/8) = 3/2 is explicitly shown, helping students understand radical arithmetic.
* Miles Edgeworth's character involvement continues while presenting an inverse similarity problem.
* The problem elegantly demonstrates that volumes contain all scaling information if you know the linear scale factor relationship.
* This naturally builds on previous scaling problems with increased sophistication.

**Pedagogical Strengths:**

* Cube root calculation
* Fraction simplification under radicals
* Inverse problem structure
* Clear conceptual progression
* Direct application to height from volume
* Excellent scaffold in similarity problems
