## Question 11

**Source:** Exercise 13D - Question 2c - Page 269

**Question Text:** "Maya has two similar cylinders. Cylinder C has height 2.2 m and volume 1.6 m³. Cylinder D has height 1 m. Find the volume of cylinder D (in m³, to 1 decimal place)."

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** 0.2

**Explanation Provided:**

* Step 1: k = 1/2.2 ≈ 0.4545
* Step 2: Volume of D = k³ × 1.6 m³
* Step 3: Volume of D = (0.4545)³ × 1.6
* Step 4: Volume of D ≈ 0.0939 × 1.6 ≈ 0.150 m³
* Rounded to 1 decimal place: 0.2 m³

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

* Excellent practical problem! Applies similarity to cylinders with decimal measurements.
* Outstanding pedagogical value: shows both the fraction approach (5/11 for exact) and the decimal approach (0.4545 for approximation).
* The explanation shows the scale factor calculation with decimals, demonstrating computational fluency.
* The rounding from 0.150 to 0.2 (rounding up due to 1 decimal place requirement) is clearly shown.
* Maya Fey's character involvement continues while presenting real-world similar measurements.
* The problem naturally extends from cubes and pyramids to cylinders, showing the generality of the scaling principle.
* Decimal calculations reflect real-world measurement scenarios rather than "textbook" fractions.

**Pedagogical Strengths:**

* Decimal arithmetic practice
* Rounding and precision
* Direct application to cylinders
* Clear step-by-step calculation
* Shows both exact and approximate approaches
* Real-world context (heights and volumes)
