## Question 10

**Source:** Exercise 13D - Question 2b - Page 269

**Question Text:** "Phoenix found two similar pyramids. Pyramid A has base length 12 cm and volume x cm³. Pyramid B has base length 20 cm and volume 2000 cm³. Find the volume of pyramid A (round to nearest whole number)."

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** 432

**Explanation Provided:**

* Step 1: k = 20/12 = 5/3
* Step 2: Volume of B = k³ × volume of A
* Step 3: 2000 = (5/3)³ × volume of A
* Step 4: 2000 = (125/27) × volume of A
* Step 5: Volume of A = 2000 × 27/125 = 432 cm³

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

* Excellent inverse problem! Requires solving for the unknown volume given the scale relationship.
* Outstanding pedagogical value: teaches algebraic manipulation with the scaling formula, not just direct calculation.
* The explanation shows all five steps with clear fraction arithmetic and algebraic rearrangement.
* Perfect progression: Q11 uses given information forward; Q12 solves backwards using the same principle.
* Phoenix Wright's character involvement continues while presenting an investigative problem (finding an unknown volume).
* The non-integer scale factor (5/3) prevents simple mental math and tests real mathematical thinking.
* The final calculation clearly shows the reciprocal multiplication approach: multiply by 27/125 rather than divide by 125/27, reinforcing algebraic thinking.

**Pedagogical Strengths:**

* Clear inverse problem structure
* Fraction arithmetic practice
* Algebraic equation solving
* Natural progression from Q9
* Well-explained steps with intermediate results
