## Question 1

**Source:** Exercise 13A - Question 1a - Page 257

**Question Text:** "Phoenix examines two triangles ABC and DEF. Triangle ABC has sides marked with single tick marks on all three sides. Triangle DEF also has single tick marks on all three sides. Are these triangles congruent? Answer "yes" or "no" and state the reason (SSS, SAS, ASA, or RHS)."

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** yes, SSS

**Explanation Provided:**
- The tick marks show that all three sides of triangle ABC equal all three sides of triangle DEF.
- When all three sides match, we have SSS congruence.
- SSS = Side-Side-Side congruence

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Excellent opening question! Introduces congruence with the simplest criterion (SSS).
- Outstanding pedagogical value: uses visual tick marks to represent equal sides, a standard geometric notation that students need to learn.
- The explanation clearly defines SSS congruence and connects the visual notation to the criterion.
- Good scaffold: starting with SSS before moving to more complex criteria (SAS, ASA, RHS) is pedagogically sound.
- Miles Edgeworth's character involvement as an examiner fits perfectly with investigative geometry work.
- The answer format (yes/no, plus reason) teaches that congruence requires both confirmation AND justification.
- This naturally introduces the chapter's focus on triangle congruence criteria.
