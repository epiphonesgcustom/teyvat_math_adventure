## Question 4

**Source:** Exercise 13A - Question 1d - Page 257

**Question Text:** "Apollo examines two triangles ABC and KLM. Triangle ABC has sides AB and BC marked equal to KL and LM respectively. However, the triangles look different in shape. Can we conclude they are congruent? Answer "yes" or "no"."

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** no

**Explanation Provided:**
- NO, we cannot conclude they are congruent!
- Having only two equal sides (SSA) is NOT a valid congruence test.
- We would need:
  - The third side (SSS), OR
  - The included angle (SAS), OR
  - Another angle in the right position (ASA/AAS)
- SSA does not guarantee congruence!

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Excellent "counterexample" question! Tests understanding of what does NOT work for congruence.
- Outstanding pedagogical value: explicitly teaches that SSA (Side-Side-Angle) is NOT a valid congruence criterion, which is a critical misconception to address.
- The explanation clearly states "SSA is not valid" and explains what additional information would be needed.
- Great teaching moment: by showing that two equal sides aren't enough, students understand why the specific criteria (SSS, SAS, ASA, RHS) exist.
- Apollo Justice's character involvement continues narrative engagement while presenting a conceptual challenge.
- The visual hint ("triangles look different in shape") helps students see that mathematical criteria matter more than appearance.
- This naturally teaches the limits of congruence criteria and why geometry requires rigorous proof, not just appearance.

**Pedagogical Note:** This is excellent for preventing the "SSA fallacy" that many students struggle with. By explicitly teaching what doesn't work, the curriculum helps students understand why certain criteria are sufficient.
