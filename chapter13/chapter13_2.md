## Question 2

**Source:** Exercise 13A - Question 1b - Page 257

**Question Text:** "Edgeworth presents two right triangles XYZ and PQR. Both have right angles marked, their hypotenuses are marked with double tick marks (equal), and one side is marked with single tick marks (equal). Are these triangles congruent? Answer "yes" or "no" and state the reason."

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** yes, RHS

**Explanation Provided:**
- Both triangles have:
  - A right angle
  - Equal hypotenuses (double tick marks)
  - One equal side (single tick marks)
- This gives us RHS congruence = Right angle-Hypotenuse-Side

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Excellent second question! Introduces RHS (Right-angle-Hypotenuse-Side) congruence, specific to right triangles.
- Outstanding pedagogical value: requires recognizing that right triangles have special congruence properties beyond the general triangle criteria.
- The explanation clearly lists all three required elements and defines the RHS criterion.
- Good use of tick marks: different number of marks (single vs. double) teaches visual notation for different equal elements.
- Miles Edgeworth's character continues to present increasingly complex triangle comparisons, building narrative tension.
- The focus on right angles teaches students that geometry often recognizes special cases with their own rules.
- This naturally extends from SSS to RHS, showing that different triangle types have different criteria.
