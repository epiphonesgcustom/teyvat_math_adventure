## Question 3

**Source:** Exercise 13A - Question 1c - Page 257

**Question Text:** "Maya found two triangles ABC and DEF. Both have two sides marked equal (AB = DE, BC = EF) and the angle between those sides is equal (∠B = ∠E). Are these triangles congruent? Answer "yes" or "no" and state the reason."

**Result:** ✓ Objection Sustained (CORRECT)

**Answer Given:** yes, SAS

**Explanation Provided:**
- We have:
  - Two equal sides: AB = DE and BC = EF
  - The included angle: ∠B = ∠E
- This is SAS congruence = Side-Angle-Side

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Excellent third question! Introduces SAS (Side-Angle-Side) congruence, requiring the angle to be included (between the two sides).
- Outstanding pedagogical value: explicitly mentions the "included angle," which is critical to understanding why the angle must be between the sides.
- The explanation clearly identifies the two sides and the angle, with "included angle" terminology teaching proper geometric language.
- Good implicit warning: the SAS criterion requires the angle to be between the sides, teaching students that order and position matter in geometry.
- Maya Fey's character involvement continues narrative engagement while presenting increasingly sophisticated congruence criteria.
- The problem naturally extends from SSS and RHS to introduce angles as part of the congruence criteria.
- This sets up the distinction between SAS and ASA (next), as both involve angles and sides.
